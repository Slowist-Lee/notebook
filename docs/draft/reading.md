## Early Research on Air
In the field of chemistry, the understanding of the word "air" has undergone radical change. Air for John Mayow, a seventeenth-century chemist, was essentially a receptacle for airborne particles, and through them manifested a variety of chemical properties.But although Mayow and a few other chemists did detect specific chemical properties in what we call gases (including our carbon dioxide), most chemists left them unaccounted for until the beginning of the eighteenth century.As chemists became aware that the atmosphere itself (and not just particles within it) had a role to play in combustion, respiration, and other reactions, they did not attribute this to the chemical properties of air but rather to substances that air could absorb and release according to circumstances.Thus, air provided a physical environment in which some reactions took place.



In the early 1700s, the air was widely seen as just such an environment, and "air" and "the air" were one and the same thing. Chemists were not in the habit of regarding airs or gases as having different chemical properties. There was simply air. One obvious reason for this was practical Chemists could examine solids and liquids, exposing them to a variety of tests and seeing how they contributed to assorted reactions. Chemists had, however, no comparable way of examining air; and they came to view chemistry as the sum total of the reactions of solids and liquids, excluding gases. Chemists stressed chemical qualities over physical properties like weight and let physicists deal with air. Chemists generally did not examine air, and they did not try to weigh it. That does not mean that chemists did not weigh substances. They did a lot of weighing, and pharmacists and metallurgists did more. But weighing gases was outside their brief. In the Encyclopedia of Diderot and d'Alembert, published between 1751 and 1775. readers were told that "the incoercibility of gases will remove them from our researches for a long time to come."



By the time of the Encyclopedia, however, this had begun to change One of the first and key sources of change was the invention by the Reverend Stephen Hales of a new instrument, the pneumatic trough. This instrument is important for what it made possible in the handling of air. The history of its invention and early use illustrates the difference there may be between the motives for inventing a device and the ways in which that device is used.



Hales was a botanist and chemist as well as a physiologist. He wrote a book in 1727 investigating mechanical subjects like the pressure of sap in plants. But Hales went further, addressing chemical as well as physiological questions. He urged chemists to consider air chemically. He described an instrument for washing the air produced in the course of a chemical reaction. He wanted to get rid of impurities in the air by letting it pass through water. Air passed from a reaction vessel through water in a trough (or tube) and then into a second vessel that was partly filled with water and that could capture air. 



In devising this apparatus, Hales had coincidentally furnished an instrument for catching and holding air, which could then be subjected to various tests. Used in this way the apparatus became known as the pneumatic trough half a century after its invention, it became a staple of the chemical laboratory. It also became one of the key instruments in the reform of chemistry that we know as the chemical revolution because it was essential to incorporating a whole new state of matter, the gaseous state, into chemistry, alongside the already studied solid and liquid states. Once that step had been taken, it was possible to speculate and then to demonstrate that the gaseous state, like the solid and liquid states, could contain a variety of chemical substances. This was an enormous step, and it did not happen overnight. Hales had shown that air could be contained, washed, and purified, and tested chemically as well as physically. This, however, did not lead him to think that there was more than one kind of air. Air for him remained air, not one of a number of airs. Other chemists would take that essential step.

## Electrical Energy from the Ocean
Solar energy reaching Earth is responsible for differential heating of the atmosphere and thus air circulation as wind.Some of the energy of wind is transferred to the oceans, where it causes waves and is partly responsible for oceanic currents,although Earth's rotation also plays a role in currents. Gravitational attraction between Earth and the Sun and Moon generates tides and,along with Earth's rotation, causes most coastal areas to experience a twice-daily rise and fall of sea level In short, the oceans possess a tremendous reservoir of largely untapped energy.



If we could effectively harness the energy possessed by the oceans, an almost limitless, largely nonpolluting energy supply would be ensured. Unfortunately, ocean energy is diffuse, meaning that the amount of energy for a given volume of water is small and thus difficult to concentrate and use. Several ways of using ocean energy are being considered or are under development,and one is currently in use, although it accounts for only a tiny proportion of all energy production. Of the several sources of ocean energy-temperature differences with depth,currents,waves,and tides-only the last shows much promise for the near future.  



Ocean water at depth might be as much as 25° C colder than surface water, a difference that allows for ocean thermal energy conversion (OTEC). OTEC exploits this temperature difference to run turbines and generate electricity.The amount of energy available is enormous, but a number of practical problems must be solved before it can be used For one thing, any potential site must be close to land and also have a sufficiently rapid change with depth to result in the required temperature difference. Furthermore, enormous quantities of warm and cold seawater would have to circulate through an electrical-generating plant, thus requiring that large surface areas be devoted to this purpose.



The concept of OTEC is more than a century old, but despite several decades of research,no commercial OTEC plants are operating or even under construction, although small experimental ones have been tested in Hawaii and Japan.



Wind-generated ocean currents, such as the Gulf Stream,which flows along the east coast of North America,also possess energy that might be tapped to generate electricity.Unlike streams that can be dammed to impound a reservoir, any electrical generating facility exploiting oceanic currents would have to concentrate currents' diffuse energy and contend with any unpredictable changes in direction. In addition, whereas hydroelectric generating plants on land depend on the rapid movement of water from a higher elevation to the turbines,the energy of ocean currents comes from their flow velocity, which is at most a few kilometers per hour.



The most obvious form of energy in the oceans lies in waves. Harnessing wave energy and converting it to electricity is not a new idea, and it has been used on an extremely limited scale.Unfortunately, the energy possessed by a wave is distributed along its crest and is difficult to concentrate. Furthermore, any facility would have to be designed to withstand the effects of storms and saltwater corrosion.The Japanese have developed wave-energy devices to power lighthouses and buoys, and a facility capable of providing power to about 300 homes began operating in Scotland during September 2000.



Perhaps tidal power is the most promising form of ocean energy. In fact, it has been used for centuries in some coastal areas to run mills, but its use at present for electrical generation is limited.Most coastal areas experience a twice-daily rise and fall of tides, but only a few areas are suitable for exploiting this energy source. One limitation is that the tidal range must be at least five meters, and there must also be a coastal region where water can be stored following high tide.



Suitable sites for using tidal power are limiled not only by tidal range but also by location. Many areas along the U. S. Gulf Coast would certainly benefit from lidal power plants, but a tide range of generally less than one meter precludes the possibility of development. Even areas with an appropriate tidal range such as the Arctic islands of Canada offer little potential because of their great distances from population centers.

## Minoan Palaces

The Minoan culture on the island of Crete in the Aegean Sea flourished from about 3000to 1100 B.C.In what is known as the Palace Period (ca. 2000-1450 B. C.), power was centralized in palaces and, later, in villas. According to one authority, the five primary economic functions of Minoan palaces during much of the Palace era were (1) production of manufactured goods, (2) consumption of food and manufactured goods. (3) regulation of local and internal exchange. (4) regulation of international and external exchange, and (5) use as depositories (storage facilities)



The production and storage of manufactured goods are evident from the archaeological digs at Phaistos and Mallia. important palace sites, Excavations of the earliest phases at Phaistos (those from the so-called Firsl Palace Period, which ended about 1700 B.C.)revealed two areas dedicated to economic activity. Unit A contained several large storage vessels originally filled with foodstuffs, including liquids such as wine and oil. Nearby Unit B was the palace workshop. Here,excavators found tools used for stoneworking (a lapidary workshop), several loom weights (a weaving workshop), and two potter's wheels (a ceramics workshop). Clay sealings from a smaller room in Unit B may indicate where finished products were processed for storage or export. By the Second Palace Period (roughly 1700-1450 B.C.), there were even more food storage vessels present and an archive room (a room for storing documents)



Similar finds appeared at Mallia. In the northwest quarter of the palace, excavators discovered obsidian, soapstone,and a reddish marble called rosso antico, all evidently part of the lapidary (slonecuttmg) workshop. A potter's workshop was also present within the palace walls. During part of this period, the workshop of a bronze smithy was located just outside the palace walls. It is actually surprising that such an industry would be so close to any residential quarters, considering the unpleasant fumes given off by the work and the rather high potential for fires. Nevertheless, at a somewhat later date, the palace walls were extended so that the smithy was located within the palace itself.Clearly,this was an industry over which the palace wanted to keep very close control.



The role of Minoan palaces as depositories and regulators of local distribution and trade may be seen in the koulouras-large,stone-lined pits located at Knossos. Phaistos,and in a slightly altered guise, at Mallia. There is continued debate as to the purpose of these huge storage bins. It was originally suggested that they were rubbish pits. Some modern scholars believe that they were giant tree planters. But the usual interpretation is that they were for gram storage,with the koulouras at Knossos being able to hold enough gram to feed 1,000 people and the koulouras at Phaistos being able to hold enough for 300 people. In such a case, the palace would have received a substantial portion of the agricultural produce of the surrounding farms, stored it, and then distributed it to the more specialized,nonagricultural populace of the palace region.



Palatial control over foreign trade is more difficult to prove archaeologically, as there is often no way to determine where on Crete any specific item found abroad was made. One argument often brought to the fore is that only the palaces would have the capital (to use a modern term) to finance the goods and shipping for long trade journeys, not to mention to handle the risks of possible sea wrecks. Another argument,however,lies in the nature of the Minoan goods found abroad.For example,Kamares ware pottery from Minoan Crete has come to light on the coasts of Cyprus and in areas of the Near East such as Egypt and Syria. This Kamares ware is clearly a product of palatial manufacture. The ceramics from before and after the classical Kamares wares are clearly local creations-Knossian ware being distinct from Malhan ware. By contrast, the Kamares ware made in the palaces is similar from palace to palace but is utterly distinct from the provincial wares. The number of foreign goods stored in the palaces,especially Zakro, also gives evidence for the palatial control of international exchange.

## Early Horses
The earliest-known horse fossils come from the Eocene epoch (from 57 to 34 million years ago),and they are so different from the modern version that it was not initially realized that there was any relation.Dawn horse,or Eohippus,as this animal has been called,has been found in both Europe and North America. Eohippus was tiny,about the size of a small dog,and apparently lived in wooded areas.These animals had hooves but,in contrast to modern horses,they had four hoofed toes on the front feet,three on the rear,and the hooves were padded. Eohippus was also pug-nosed by comparison to modern horses,and its teeth reveal that it was a browser that fed on a variety of plants.In fact,although it was completely herbivorous (plant eating),this little horse had canine teeth-a reminder that many of its predecessors were carnivores (meat eaters).



Throughout the Eocene and Oligocene epochs (from 57 to 23 million years ago),the descendants of Eohippus evolved in a fairly straightforward way that is well documented by their fossils.They became gradually larger;the middle toe, eventually to become the single hoof of the modern horses,became stronger and more prominent,and the grinding surfaces of the teeth became larger,with complex,resistant ridges.But the resemblance to Eohippus remained clear.It was only in the Miocene (from 23 to 5 million years ago),coincident with the spread of grassy prairies,that abrupt changes took place,resulting in several different lineages of horse evolution,only one of which is still extant:the modern horse.



Several of the physical characteristics of today's animals are ultimately linked to their diet of grasses. Foremost among the Miocene modifications that led toward present-day horses were changes in the teeth and the shape of the head.Compared to the succulent leaves of tropical trees that were the fodder for some of the horse's ancestors, grasses are abrasive and much more difficult to chew and grind.The response of the Miocene horses was to develop teeth with much more elaborate and resistant grinding surfaces and with much larger crowns,at least part of which could grow out of the gums as they were worn down.These changes meant that the head had to be much deeper,and the muzzle longer,to make room for the long rows of grinding teeth along the horse's cheeks.At about the same time,the legs and feet of the ancestors of today's horses became better adapted to rapid running across the spreading grasslands.This occurred through fusion of several of the independent bones in the lower parts of the legs,making them stiffer,and through further emphasis of the central hoofed toe,which by now bore the entire weight of the animal.In place of a foot,the horse has a single toe at the end of its leg.



By the middle or late Miocene,many of the extant horses were at least superficially similar to modern horses.Based on the fossil record,much of their development seems to have occurred in North America,but by the Pleistocene epoch (from 1.6 million to 10,000 years ago),the modern horse genus,Equus,had spread over much of the world.Then,inexplicably,only 8,000 to 10,000 years ago, horses disappeared from North America.The reason for this extinction is unknown. Whatever the cause,it is a fact that the plains of North America were without these animals for thousands of years,until horses brought from Europe by the early Spanish explorers escaped and began to repopulate the vast grasslands.



It is clear that many of the familiar features of the modern horse are directly or indirectly related to its diet and its preferred environment,grasslands.But how and why did the grasslands develop when they did?There are competing theories on this question,but only a few are consistent with the evidence.Most of these invoke a change in global climate as an important factor,perhaps the overriding factor.In particular,grasslands expanded rapidly as the climate in continental interiors became cooler and drier.

## The Commercialization of Pearl River Agriculture

The Pearl River Delta of southern China was an agriculturally rich region. Formed of alluvial soils that had been captured from the silt flowing down from the major rivers,these sand flats,as the Chinese called them,were worked and reworked until they became very productive rice paddies that by the sixteenth century annually produced two crops of rice and one of vegetables and wheat.Peasant farmers produced on their own plots much of the food the family consumed.However,agriculture in the region could not be called subsistence agriculture,for many nonfood commercial crops were grown and exchanged in markets that dotted the countryside.Besides rice,peasant farmers in the Pearl River Delta grew sugarcane,hemp,cotton,and mulberries to feed silkworms, among other crops.



But while commerce and market exchanges were an important part of the rural economy until about 1550,the rural economy was not commercialized.As the population grew from 1400 to 1550,the gross volume of crops marketed and the number of rural markets both increased,but they did so at the rate of population growth.The proportion of agricultural land devoted to commercial crops in 1550 was about what it had been in 1400.But after 1550 the agricultural economy of the region became highly commercialized.Markets and marketing activity expanded at a rate faster than that of the population.



The most immediate stimulus for the commercialization of the economy was the new demand for Chinese goods-in particular silk and porcelains-from European traders who arrived in the South China Sea in the sixteenth century.For the Pearl River region,the critical trade flow was triangular,linked by the Portuguese.Either with their own funds or with silver that Japanese merchants supplied,Portuguese traders headed up the Pearl River to biannual fairs in the city of Guangzhou where they exchanged silver for export goods.These goods were loaded onto ships bound for the Japanese city of Nagasaki.Japanese merchants in Nagasaki paid in silver for the Chinese goods,launching another round of trade.Trade through Manila,in the Philippines,also brought silver into the South China economy. Chinese merchants from Guangdong and Fujian provinces sailed to Manila with their goods,which the Spanish bought with silver.From there the silver flowed back to China as the Chinese commodities found their way to Europe.By 1600 this trade resulted in an annual inflow of perhaps 200,000 kilograms of silver into the coastal economies of south and southeast China.



In the Pearl River Delta,the silk industry developed on a base that was first created by the sand-flat fields and then a particular combination of fish ponds with fruit trees. In the fifteenth century peasant farmers in the Pearl River Delta began replacing some of their sand-flat rice fields with fishponds,probably in response to increased demand from Guangzhou.On the embankments,peasant farmers in the early Ming Dynasty (1368-1644)mostly planted fruit trees,giving rise to the fruit tree and fishpond combination.The carp fed on organic matter that either dropped or was thrown into the pond,while the mud scooped up from the pond fertilized the fruit trees and the rice fields and added height to the embankments and more protection for the fishponds.



The fruit tree and fishpond culture provided a ready-made base for expansion of the silk industry.As the demand for silk increased,peasant farmers replaced the fruit trees with mulberry trees (silkworms feed on mulberry leaves)and then began digging up even more rice paddies to expand this system.By 1581 in the Longshan area of Shunde county,for example,eighteen percent of the productive land was fishponds and,combined with the mulberry trees on the embankments, accounted for about thirty percent of the cultivated land area.
