Ladies and Gentlemen,  

I'm delighted to be here in Zhejiang University in this beautiful month of April, to attend this Academic Summit, and to speak on the opening of the summit before embarking on a journey of knowledge exchange, intellectual discourse, and collaborative exploration. At the outset, on behalf of Zhejiang University, I would firstly like to extend my warmest welcome to all our distinguished guests!  

I would firstly give thanks to the organizing committee for giving Zhejiang University such an opportunity to host this event, for the level of collaboration has not only enriched academic discourse but has also fostered new partnerships with leading institutions nationally and globally. Zhejiang University also lives up to our expectations. These years, we have made significant progress in IT, largely due to collaborations with top universities across China. Through joint research and interdisciplinary projects, we have led the way in AI, data science and so on. Zhejiang University is also committed to nurturing future IT leaders and actively participating in academic conferences and strengthening cooperation.This collaborative approach not only boosts the university's reputation but also advances IT nationally and globally, shaping technology's future.  

This summit serves as a platform for intellectual collaboration, where minds from diverse fields ,converge to tackle some of the most pressing challenges. I firmly believe, it is through the exchange of ideas, the sharing of insights, and the forging of new collaborations that we can push the boundaries of knowledge and drive meaningful change together.  


In closing, I wish everyone a productive, enriching, and memorable experience at this wonderful Zhejiang University Academic Summit. May our discussions be fruitful and our pursuit of knowledge be relentless. Wishing the academic summit a smooth and successful event, and wishing Zhejiang University continued success!  
Thank you!
