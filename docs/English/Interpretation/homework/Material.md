## TikTok听证会周受资六分钟自我陈述

Thank you. Chair Rodgers, Ranking Member Pallone, Members of the Committee. Thank you for your time. I am Shou Chew and I’m from Singapore. That’s where I was born as for my parents, and after serving in Singapore’s military, I moved to the UK to attend college and then here to the US to attend business school. I actually met my wife here, by the way. She was just born a few miles away from here in Virginia. Two years ago, I became the CEO of TikTok. Today we have more than a billion monthly active users around the world, including over 150 million in the United States. Our app is a place where people can be creative and curious, and we’re close to 5 million American businesses. Mostly small businesses go to find new customers and to fuel their growth. Now, as TikTok has grown, we’ve tried to learn the lessons of companies that have come before us, especially when it comes to the safety of teenagers.

非常感谢。罗杰斯主席，Pallone高级成员，委员会成员。谢谢你抽出时间。我叫寿周，来自新加坡。就我的父母而言，我就是在那里出生的。在新加坡军队服役后，我搬到英国上大学，然后来到美国上商学院。顺便说一句，我在这里遇到了我的妻子。她刚出生在离这里几英里远的弗吉尼亚州。两年前，我成为TikTok的首席执行官。今天，我们在全球拥有超过10亿的月活跃用户，其中包括美国的1.5亿。我们的应用程序是一个人们可以发挥创造力和好奇心的地方，我们与500万美国企业有着密切的联系。大多数小企业都是为了寻找新客户并推动其增长。现在，随着TikTok的发展，我们试图吸取之前公司的教训，尤其是在青少年安全方面。

While the vast majority of people on TikTok are over 18, one of and one of our fastest growing demographics are people over 35. We spent a lot of time adopting measures to protect teenagers. Many of those measures are firsts for the social media industry. We forbid direct messaging for people under 16, and we have a 16 minute watch time by default for those under 18. We have a suite of family pairing tools so that parents can participate in their teens’ experience and make the choices they think are right for their family. We want TikTok to be a place where teenagers can come to learn, which is why we recently launched a feed that exclusively features educational videos about stem. STEM videos already have over 116 billion views on TikTok, and I think TikTok is inspiring a new generation to discover a passion for math and science.

虽然TikTok上的绝大多数人都在18岁以上，但35岁以上是我们人口增长最快的人群之一。我们花了很多时间采取措施保护青少年。其中许多措施都是社交媒体行业的第一次。我们禁止16岁以下的人直接发信息，18岁以下的默认观看时间为16分钟。我们有一套家庭配对工具，这样父母就可以参与青少年的经历，并做出他们认为适合家庭的选择。我们希望TikTok成为青少年可以学习的地方，这就是为什么我们最近推出了一个专门以stem教育视频为特色的订阅源。STEM视频在TikTok上的浏览量已经超过1160亿，我认为TikToks正在激励新一代人发现对数学和科学的热情。

Now I would also like to talk about national security concerns（事件） that you have raised that we take very, very seriously. Let me start by addressing a few misconceptions about Byte Dance, of which we are a subsidiary. Byte Dance is not owned or controlled by the Chinese government. It’s a private company. 60% of the company is owned by global institutional investors. 20% is owned by the founder and 20% owned by employees around the world. ByteDance’s five board members, three of them are American. Now TikTok itself is not available in mainland China. We’re headquartered in Los Angeles and in Singapore, and we have 7,000 employees in the US today. Still, we have heard important concerns （担忧）about the potential for unwanted foreign access to US data and potential manipulation of the TikTok US ecosystem. Our approach has never been to dismiss or trivialize any of these concerns. We have addressed them with real action now.

现在，我还想谈谈你提出的国家安全问题，我们非常、非常认真地对待这些问题。首先，让我谈谈对字节跳动的一些误解，我们是字节跳动的子公司。字节跳动并非由中国政府所有或控制。这是一家私人公司。该公司60%的股份由全球机构投资者持有。20%由创始人所有，20%由世界各地的员工所有。字节跳动的五名董事会成员，其中三名是美国人。现在TikTok本身在中国大陆是不可用的。我们的总部位于洛杉矶和新加坡，目前在美国有7000名员工。尽管如此，我们还是听到了对外国不必要地访问美国数据的可能性以及对TikTok美国生态系统的潜在操纵的重要担忧。我们从来没有忽视或轻视任何这些关切。我们现在已经用实际行动解决了这些问题。

That’s what we’ve been doing for the last two years, building what amounts to a firewall. The seals of protected US user data from unauthorized foreign access. The bottom line is this American data stored on American soil by an American company overseen by American personnel. We call this initiative Project Texas. That’s why Oracle is headquartered. Today,US TikTok data is stored by default in Oracle service only vetted personnel operating in a new company called TikTok US data security can control access to this data. Additionally, we have plans for this company to report to an independent American board with strong security credentials. Now, there’s still some work to do. We have legacy US data sitting in our service in Virginia and in Singapore. We’re deleting those and we expect that to be complete this year. When that is done, all protected US data will be under the protection of US law and under the control of the US led security team.

这就是我们过去两年一直在做的事情，建立一个相当于防火墙的东西。受保护的美国用户数据的印章，防止未经授权的外国访问。最重要的是，这些美国数据是由一家由美国人员监督的美国公司存储在美国领土上的。我们将这一举措称为德克萨斯项目。这就是为什么甲骨文的总部设在这里。如今，美国TikTok数据默认存储在Oracle服务中，只有在一家名为TikTok-美国数据安全的新公司运营的经过审查的人员才能控制对这些数据的访问。此外，我们还计划让这家公司向具有强大安全资质的独立美国董事会报告。现在，还有一些工作要做。我们在弗吉尼亚州和新加坡的服务中有遗留的美国数据。我们正在删除这些内容，预计今年将完成。一旦完成，所有受保护的美国数据都将受到美国法律的保护，并由美国领导的安全团队控制。

This eliminates the concern that some of you have shared with me that TikTok user data can be subject to Chinese law. This goes further, by the way, than what any other company in our industry have done. We will also provide unprecedented transparency and security for the source code for the TikTok app and recommendation engine. Third party validators like Oracle and others will review and validate our source code and algorithms. This will help ensure the integrity of the code that powers what Americans see on our app. We will further provide access to researchers, which helps them study and monitor our content ecosystem. Now, we believe we are the only company that offers this level of transparency.

这消除了你们中的一些人与我分享的关于TikTok用户数据可能受中国法律约束的担忧。顺便说一句，这比我们行业的任何其他公司都做得更远。我们还将为TikTok应用程序和推荐引擎的源代码提供前所未有的透明度和安全性。像Oracle和其他公司这样的第三方验证器将审查和验证我们的源代码和算法。这将有助于确保为美国人在我们的应用程序上看到的内容提供动力的代码的完整性。我们将进一步为研究人员提供访问权限，帮助他们研究和监控我们的内容生态系统。现在，我们相信我们是唯一一家提供这种透明度的公司

Now, trust is about actions we take. We have to earn their trust with decisions we make for our company and our products. The potential security, privacy,contain manipulation concerns raised about TikTok are really not unique to us. The same issues applied to other companies. We believe what’s needed are clear, transparent rules that apply broadly to all tech companies. Ownership is not at the core of addressing these concerns. Now, as I conclude, there are more than 150 million Americans who love our platform and we know we have a responsibility to protect them, which is why I’m making the following commitments to you and to all our users. Number one, we will keep safety particularly for teenagers as a top priority for us. Number two, we will firewall protected US data from unwanted foreign access. Number three, TikTok will remain a place for free expression and will not be manipulated by any government. And fourth, we will be transparent and give access to third party independent monitors to remain accountable for our commitments. I’ll be grateful for any feedback that you have, and I look forward to your questions. Thank you very much.

现在，信任就是我们所采取的行动。我们必须通过为公司和产品做出的决策来赢得他们的信任。对TikTok的潜在安全、隐私和操纵担忧并不是我们独有的。同样的问题也适用于其他公司。我们认为，我们需要的是明确、透明的规则，这些规则广泛适用于所有科技公司。所有权不是解决这些关切的核心。现在，正如我总结的那样，有超过1.5亿美国人热爱我们的平台，我们知道我们有责任保护他们，这就是为什么我要向你们和我们所有的用户做出以下承诺。第一，我们将特别是青少年的安全作为我们的首要任务。第二，我们将通过防火墙保护美国数据免受不必要的外国访问。第三，TikTok将继续是一个言论自由的地方，不会被任何政府操纵。第四，我们将保持透明，并允许第三方独立监督员对我们的承诺负责。我将感谢您的任何反馈，我期待您的问题。非常感谢你。

## UCB的演讲

### UCB——you see Berkeley

Distinguished education consul Mr.Shao Wei, distinguished staff member of Consulate General of People's Republic of China, Distinguished Berkeley professors, ladies and gentlemen, friends,

It's my great honor and privilege to be speaking on this very special and memorable occasion, On behalf of all the visiting scholars and students from China, I would like to take this opportunity to extend our deepest thanks and appreciation to our home country, to Consulate General of China in San Francisco, to Berkeley Professors, It is the financial support from the Education Ministry of China, it is the timely help and assistance from the education office, it is the enthusiastic support and great generosity from Berkeley Professors, that make us much enriched in academic understanding exhilarated in cultural travel. Thank you.

We know it is not easy to fully capture the essence of visiting experience herein Berkeley, but still, we can take back to China our own UCB.

The first letter U is understanding, After staying here almost for one year, we come to fully understand the beauty of academic research and scientific pursuits, We come to fully understand that when the east meets the west only communication and collaboration make it possible and prospering.

The second letter C is confidence, Looking back, probably we still remember how uncertain and fretful (insecure) when we first came to Berkeley. However, with one year's constant and consistent effort, many of us have put our names onto the world leading journal articles or top-notch conference presentations. My friends, when we look beyond the Pacific Ocean, we know in our country, the economy is booming, the culture is flourishing, and we have every reason to believe that, as long as we have confidence and consistent effort, our academic research will be thriving on the world stage.

The last letter B is being interested, Ever since our childhood, we have been told that interest in the best teacher, When we come here, we learn that interest guides numerous professors and scholars to the top of science and human civilization, Only with interest, we can conquer any difficulty that seems insurmountable right now, Only with interest, we can leave the short-term benefits while cherish the lifelong pursuits for the betterment of our community, our society, and the whole world at large.

My dear friends, in a TV ad for this university, a question pops up: Do you see Berkeley? U C Berkeley? We echo: Yes, we see. Yes, we see.

Thank you, Thank you very much.

## 习主席的亚运会祝酒词

尊敬的各位同事，  
尊敬的辛格代理主席，  
尊敬的巴赫主席，  
女士们，先生们，朋友们：  
Distinguished Colleagues,  
Distinguished OCA Acting President Raja Randhir Singh,  
Distinguished IOC President Thomas Bach,  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Friends,  
很高兴同各位新老朋友相聚美丽的西子湖畔，共同迎接第十九届亚洲运动会。首先，我谨代表中国政府和中国人民，并以我和我夫人的名义，对各位嘉宾的到来表示热烈欢迎！  
I am delighted to join so many old and new friends by the beautiful West Lake celebrating the opening of the 19th Asian Games. At the outset, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, and in the name of my wife and myself, I would like to extend a warm welcome to all our distinguished guests!  
今天是中国农历的秋分节气。在这个寓意丰收和团圆的日子，亚运会圣火将再次在中国点燃。自申办以来，中国认真履行承诺，全力推进各项筹办工作。我们愿同亚奥理事会和各国各地区代表团共同努力，为世界呈现一届“中国特色、亚洲风采、精彩纷呈”的体育盛会，为亚洲和国际奥林匹克运动发展作出新贡献。  
Today is the Autumn Equinox, known as Qiufen on the Chinese lunar calendar. On this day of harvest and reunion, the cauldron of the Asian Games will light up again in China. Since being honored with the right to host the Games, China has earnestly fulfilled its commitments and made every effort for its preparation. We look forward to working closely together with the Olympic Council of Asia (OCA) and delegations from all countries and regions to deliver to the world a great event that is distinctly Chinese, uniquely Asian and spectacular and to make new contribution to the Olympic Movement in Asia and the world.  
女士们、先生们、朋友们！  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Friends,  
亚洲运动会承载着亚洲人民对和平、团结、包容的美好向往。  
The Asian Games embodies the Asian people’s shared desire for peace, unity and inclusiveness.  
过去几十年，亚洲地区总体保持稳定，经济持续快速增长，成就了“风景这边独好”的亚洲奇迹。亚运会正是这一奇迹的见证者、参与者、推动者。作为山海相连、人文相亲的命运共同体，我们要以体育促和平，坚持与邻为善和互利共赢，抵制冷战思维和阵营对抗，将亚洲打造成世界和平的稳定锚。  
Over decades, Asia has enjoyed overall stability as well as sustained rapid economic growth, creating the Asian Miracle that is incomparable across the world. The Asian Games has not only been a witness to this achievement, but also a participant and a contributor. As a community with a shared future connected by mountains and rivers as well as cultural affinity, we should use sports to promote peace, pursue good neighborliness and mutual benefit, and reject Cold War mentality and bloc confrontation. We should make Asia an anchor of world peace.  
本届亚运会报名规模、项目数量均创历史新高，彰显了亚洲人民对杭州亚运会的热切期盼和坚定支持。当前，人类面临的全球性挑战前所未有，我们要以体育促团结，把握历史机遇，合作应对挑战，践行“永远向前”的亚奥理事会格言，把共同发展、开放融通的亚洲之路越走越宽。  
The 19th Asian Games has set a new record in the numbers of registered athletes and events, reflecting the great expectations and firm support of the Asian people for the Hangzhou Games. As humanity faces unprecedented global challenges, we should use sports to promote unity, seize the historic opportunity, and jointly stand up to the challenges. We should honor the OCA motto of “Ever Onward,” and open up broader prospects for the Asian road toward common development, openness and integration.  
亚洲是人类文明的重要发祥地，创造了璀璨的文明。亚运会设置了诸多富有亚洲特色的比赛项目，为体育和文化交相辉映提供了舞台，是亚洲文化兼收并蓄、博采众长、充满活力的生动写照。我们要以体育促包容，增强文明自信，坚持交流互鉴，续写亚洲文明新辉煌。  
As an important birthplace of human civilization, Asia has fostered splendid cultures. The 19th Asian Games has included many disciplines with distinctive Asian features. It provides a platform to celebrate sports and culture, and showcases Asian culture that is inclusive, vibrant and always keen to learn from others. We should use sports to promote inclusiveness, enhance confidence in our civilizations, pursue exchanges and mutual learning, and renew the glory of Asian civilizations.  
女士们、先生们、朋友们！  
Ladies and Gentlemen,  
Friends,  
千百年来，杭州以“山水登临之美，人物邑居之繁”享誉世界，被马可·波罗誉为“世界上最美丽华贵之天城”。我曾在浙江工作多年。浙江坚持改革开放，跑出了高质量发展的加速度，正在建设共同富裕示范区，是中国式现代化的先行者。祝愿大家在诗画浙江度过难忘的时光，在亚运会圣火下留下美好的记忆。  
For centuries, Hangzhou has been known for its breathtaking natural beauty, rich endowment and a thriving cultural life. Marco Polo described it as “the City of Heaven, the finest and the noblest in the world.” I once worked in Zhejiang Province for quite a few years. Committed to reform and opening up, the Province is now fast-tracking toward high-quality development. It is building a demonstration zone for common prosperity, and has become a pioneer in Chinese modernization. I wish you all an unforgettable experience in the picturesque Zhejiang and a fond memory by the flames of the Asian Games.
现在，我提议，大家共同举杯，  
Now, I would like to propose a toast,  
为本届亚运会取得圆满成功，  
To the success of the 19th Asian Games,  
为奥林匹克运动蓬勃发展，  
To the advancement of the Olympic Movement,  
为亚洲人民团结和友谊，  
To the unity and friendship of the Asian people, and  
为各位嘉宾和家人健康，  
To the health of all distinguished guests and your families.  
干杯！  
Cheers!

Shanghai is **unique** among world cities **in its variety of architectural styles**. This variety reflects the wisdom and efforts of architects, engineers, and workers - both home and abroad and is **a precious legacy** to the world.

首先，我要向你推荐外滩。它曾是亚洲最著名的一条街，它临着黄浦江，绿树成荫，供游人漫步。外滩的壮观吸引着许多远东的大公司，它们纷纷在临江的建筑里设立总部。

I'd like to recommend you the **Bund**. Once the most famous street in Asia, it is **a tree-lined promenade** along the Huangpu River. Attracted by its grandeur, the major firms of the Far East had their **headquarters** in the buildings facing the river.

#### 3. 广东

Guangdong is at the southern end of China, **covering an area of** 178,000 square kilometers, **with a population of** over 77 million. We are next to the South China Sea, close to Hong Kong and Macao SARs, with a large population of overseas Chinese. We have an abundant supply of talents, excellent external communications and a long history in foreign trade. Our contact with the outside world is **multi-leveled and multi-dimensional.**

#### 4. 杭州


杭州早在4700年前就有人居住，孕育了良渚文明。作为中国七大古都之一和重要的风景旅游和历史文化城市，杭州曾被13世纪意大利旅行家马可·波罗称赞为“世界上最美丽华贵之城”。

**Hangzhou was settled as early as 4,700 years ago, thus giving birth to the Liangzhu Civilization.** As one of the seven ancient capitals and the key scenic tourism and historical culture cities in China, Hangzhou once was applauded as **"the most splendid and luxurious city in the world"** by Marco Polo, the Italian traveler in the 13th century.

杭州是华夏文明的发祥地，中国著名的七大古都之一。跨湖桥遗址的发掘显示，早在8000多年前，就有人类在此繁衍生息。距今5000多 年前的良渚文化被称为“中华文明的曙光"。自秦时(公元前220 年)设县治以来，已有2200多年历史。五代吴越国和南宋王朝，两代建都杭州。被13世纪意大利旅行家马可波罗赞叹为“**世界上最美丽华贵之天城**”。

As one of the birthplaces of Chinese Civilization and ranking among the seven ancient capitals in China, Hangzhou **stands out as the "Famous Town of the Southeast".** The excavation of the Kuahu Bridge site indicates that **as early as 8000 years ago**, the place already saw thriving human activities. The Liangzhu Culture, dating 5000 years back, is hailed by historians **as "the dawn of civilization".** First set up as a county in the Qin Dynasty (222 BC), it has a past of over 2200 years. Hangzhou was chosen as the capital city by two dynasties, the Wuyue state in the Five Dynasties and the Southern Song dynasty. In the 13th Century, Hangzhou was recognized by Italian traveler Marco Polo as **the "most splendid and luxurious city in the world".**
