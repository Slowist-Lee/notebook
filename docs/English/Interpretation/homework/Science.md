	- 快充→快速充电：fast charging 那快充模式就是 fast charging mode  
	- 进行放电循环：conducted discharge cycles  
	- 电池续航能力：battery longevity  

最近不少手机推出了“快充”模式，有一种说法是快充会加快手机电池的衰老，但是数据表明恰恰相反。在实验中，科学家们分别设置120w和18w的充电功率，为6部iQ007手机进行了500次放电循环。实验结果表明，快充组的电池容量下降了12.3%，慢充组下降了11.8%，并没有显著差异。而使用苹果手机做的类似实验中，快充组的表现甚至略微优于慢充组。这说明，使用快充模式，对于手机的电池健康影响不大。  
所以，我们应该做什么来更好地维持我们的手机电池健康，延缓衰老时间呢？研究者们提供了三个建议：  
1. 尽量做到让手机的电池电量比例保持在30%到80%，减少放电循环次数  
2. 尽量不要把手机置于高温和低温环境中，这会影响电池的续航能力  
3. 如果手机提醒电池最大容量小于75%，应及时更换电池  

事实上，手机电池容量衰老是一个长期的过程，没有必要让你的“手机电量焦虑”上升到“精神焦虑”。如果你觉得这期视频好的话，可以帮我点个赞，谢谢！  

Recently, many smartphones have introduced "fast charging" modes. There is a common belief that fast charging accelerates battery aging, but data shows otherwise. In an experiment, scientists set charging powers of 120W and 18W for six iQOO 7 smartphones and conducted 500 discharge cycles. The results showed that the battery capacity of the fast-charging group decreased by 12.3%, while the slow-charging group decreased by 11.8%, indicating no significant difference. A similar experiment with Apple phones even showed that the fast-charging group performed slightly better than the slow-charging group. This suggests that using fast charging mode has little impact on the health of smartphone batteries.  

So, what should we do to better maintain our phone batteries and delay aging? Researchers offer three suggestions:  
1. Try to keep the battery charge level between 30% and 80% to reduce the number of discharge cycles.  
2. Avoid exposing your phone to extreme high or low temperatures, as this can affect battery longevity.  
3. If your phone indicates that the maximum battery capacity is below 75%, it is advisable to replace the battery promptly.  
In fact, the aging of smartphone batteries is a long-term process, and there is no need to let your "battery anxiety" escalate to "mental anxiety." If you found this video helpful, please give it a thumbs up. Thank you!
