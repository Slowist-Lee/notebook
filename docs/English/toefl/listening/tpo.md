expect you do: 就是要求，所以B√ **（听到大胆选）** 

这一段的语速很快，**在语速很快的情况下不要记**

L1 感觉有点难，主要是长段的分析，听结构！！！

example也应该记一下，然后去和论点对应着听结构 

Conv2 有点犯傻了，但留一下错题

L3这道因为题目没看仔细，还有一部分生词的缘故

这题着实有点恶心了感觉，**要往文章大局来考虑？**

B的问题主要在于【project requirement】，先看requirement具体指的是：create an Internet marketing campaign and a strategy for …

- 学生纠结的点：我们没有零售之外的经验，所以可能做不好finance strategy
- 老师反驳的点：金融公司也有产品，所以你们不是毫无经验

上面的交锋里面没有和project requirement有主要交集的地方，所以B不合理，C更正确。

Lec 3. T3 这题抓住这篇文章讲的是房子，主要记那块的结构，不要记太细了（这块主要是因为记录导致听不到）

> Let's turn now to leisure activities. Some people play sports. Some people perform music. What ever you choose. What about you? Historical patterns of leisure reveal a lot about people of the past. Movies especially gave different sorts of people in the United States something in common? See, in the late 1800s, society in the US was divided by a variety of things region, class, ethnicity. But in the early 1900s, the development of motion pictures helped to create a shared culture for a lot of Americans. To start out, recreation in the late 1800s was somewhat fragmented. People from similar backgrounds tended to do things together, often apart from people of other groups.

> Activities like sports leagues would be organized based on ethnicity or class, and most activities were located in your immediate neighborhood. This pattern began to break down in the early 1900s. There are a number of reasons for this. Migration to cities is one reason. People were sort of thrust together into new urban areas, both people born in the United States and people born abroad. Some of this was because there were new job opportunities in the cities. Office work was emerging as a major employment area, as well as retail work, such as working in big department stores. As a result, new commercial entertainment emerged around this time. Dance halls, amusement parks, and most notably, motion pictures. The earliest movies were first shown in vaudeville theaters. Vaudeville was a sort of a kind of variety entertainment show in theaters.

> [00:02:03] Professor:

> There would be short plays. There would be dance numbers, and short motion pictures were just a small part of the show. Then, beginning around 1905, motion pictures were increasingly shown on their own in little storefront theaters called Nickelodeons. A Nickelodeon would usually be, well, there's not much to them, just a darkened room, a screen, and a projector. They were aimed at people coming in casually off the streets. There was no set start time. People just came and went. Nickelodeon Movies were short, just about 20 or 30 minutes long. The standard movie at the time was only that long, partly because of the way film was made, in that you could only get so much film footage onto one movie reel.
> 
> [00:02:53] Professor:
> 
> Anyway, there was an enormous amount of product, an enormous number of movies created for the Nickelodeons. Think about it. You have 20 minute movies, so you have to have a lot of different movies in the course of the day so that people are going to stay and enjoy themselves and want to. Come back again to see more movies in the future. Yet almost none of these have survived. We have very few movies left over from this time, but we know from the reviews that there were just tons of movies being made. One of the most surprising things is that these movies broke down some of the boundaries of leisure culture at the time.

> For one thing, they were accessible to a wide variety of people because movies were silent. Recent immigrants didn't need to know the language to understand what was going on. They could just go and watch the action. Families could also attend movies. Parents could bring children. They could bring babies because nobody needed to hear sound. Nobody would be bothered if there was a screaming kid. Perhaps unlike modern moviegoers, you could let the kids run around and the adults could still have an opportunity to be with their friends. So anyway, this situation created a new, widely popular leisure experience where people from very different backgrounds might have seen the same movies.

> Now, by the 1920s, the moviegoing experience shifted from the small storefront, larger permanent theaters that showed a major feature a long multi-reel movie. Also. Sound was introduced, which changed the game. On one hand, you could do a lot more with sound. People talked. You could hear them. You could add music, could increase the drama. You could have serious films. But at the same time, it became less accessible. You have to have a quieter audience and an audience that understands English, because these movies rely on the spoken word. So the art form or the commercial form changed in ways that were profitable for the movie industry, but it also irrevocably changed the experience of the audience.

> [!question]+ Question
> What is the lecture mainly about?
> A. The role of immigrants in sports and entertainment in the United States in the early 1900s
> B. How participation in a leisure activity reflected broader changes in the United States in the 1900s
> C. Differences between vaudeville and nickelodeon movies
> D. The depiction of people from different social backgrounds in movies in the early 1900s

> [!check]- Answer
> 这道题四个选项都挺牵强的，但是A存在理解上的问题：The role of immigrants in sports and entertainment 这个的意思是 role of immigrants在 sports and entertainment里发挥的作用，和听力原文本八竿子打不着；
> 
> B. 比较隐晦，主要还是体现在关于migration这里的表述上。
> 
> 主要剩下几个选项都差太远了。

> 这是原解析：
> 
> ---
> 
> 正确答案是B：How participation in a leisure activity reflected broader changes in the United States in the 1900s。
> 
> 详细解析：
> 
> 这篇讲座主要讨论的是20世纪初美国休闲活动的变化，以及这种变化如何反映了社会的更广泛变动，尤其是随着城市化进程和移民涌入，休闲活动如何打破了原有的社会分隔，创造了共享文化。电影作为一种新兴的娱乐方式，在这一过程中起到了关键作用。因此，正确答案是B。
> 
> A 选项：The role of immigrants in sports and entertainment in the United States in the early 1900s
> 原文并没有专门讨论移民在美国体育和娱乐中的角色，虽然讲到移民与其他群体一起在城市生活并参与了新的娱乐形式（如电影），但这并不是讲座的主要内容。移民在休闲活动中的参与被提及，但并没有详细阐述其对体育或娱乐的影响。讲座更多地是在讨论如何通过电影这种休闲活动反映了更广泛的社会变动。
> 原文引用：“Migration to cities is one reason. People were sort of thrust together into new urban areas, both people born in the United States and people born abroad.” 这里提到了移民涌入城市，但讲座没有集中讨论移民在娱乐或体育中的作用，而是侧重于娱乐形式如何推动了社会融合。
> 
> B 选项：How participation in a leisure activity reflected broader changes in the United States in the 1900s
> 这是正确答案，因为讲座的核心内容就是如何通过电影这一休闲活动体现出20世纪初美国社会的变动。讲座中讲述了随着城市化进程、工作方式的变化以及移民涌入城市，休闲活动从单一的区域性、阶级性变得更加普及和共享。电影成为了促进这一文化变革的重要因素，突破了民族、阶级的界限，让来自不同背景的人们都能够参与到共同的娱乐活动中来。
> 原文引用：“Movies especially gave different sorts of people in the United States something in common... the development of motion pictures helped to create a shared culture for a lot of Americans.”
> 
> C 选项：Differences between vaudeville and nickelodeon movies
> 讲座中提到了vaudeville（杂耍表演）和Nickelodeon电影的区别，但这只是讲座的一个小部分。讲座并没有专门讨论这两者的对比，而是提到了电影如何从最初的vaudeville表演的一部分发展成独立的娱乐形式。因此，这个选项并不是讲座的核心内容。
> 原文引用：“The earliest movies were first shown in vaudeville theaters. Vaudeville was a sort of a kind of variety entertainment show in theaters... Then, beginning around 1905, motion pictures were increasingly shown on their own in little storefront theaters called Nickelodeons.”
> 
> D 选项：The depiction of people from different social backgrounds in movies in the early 1900s
> 讲座没有具体讨论电影中不同社会背景的人物描绘，而是侧重于电影如何作为一种新型的休闲活动，促进了不同社会背景人群的互动和共享文化的形成。虽然提到了电影让来自不同背景的人能共同观看，但并没有详细讨论电影中对不同社会背景人物的表现。
> 原文引用：“This situation created a new, widely popular leisure experience where people from very different backgrounds might have seen the same movies.” 这里提到电影让不同背景的人们共享娱乐经验，但并没有讨论电影如何描绘这些人物。
