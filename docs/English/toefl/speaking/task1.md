### 回答v2

From my point of view, I disagree that it is necessary to protect children from learning about difficulties in life. First of all, they can face the difficulties in life tougher and can be mentally prepared. Secondly, they can learn methods to face the difficulties in life, such as thinking outside of the box and to be persistent. Therefore, I think children should learn about difficulties in life.

### 回答v1

In this case, I want to choose to attend my sister's birthday party. First of all, I think my sister's birthday party symbolizes the relationship and love in the family, and I think this is of the most priority. Secondly, I think the research work on the weekend isn't very suitable. <font color="#ff0000">Uh, it isn't very suitable.</font> And I think my professor is, uh, easy to communicate with. Therefore, I think I will choose my sister's birthday party first as to show my love for my sister.

Honestly, I would choose to attend my sister's birthday party. First off, I think **family should always come first**. This is because my sister and my other family members have **loved me and supported me unconditionally**. They have been through a lot of difficulties with me and helped me during those times. So you know, on this important birthday, I will definitely **be there for my sister** to celebrate with her. Besides, I would like to go to the birthday party because I need to **relax and unwind**. This is because I'm really stressed during the week and on the birthday parties I can do something fun, like **singing karaoke or blowing the candles together** with my sister. So this can help me to **forget about all the troubles and stress**. Therefore, I would like to attend this birthday party.

## Exercise 3

> [!note] 2025.1.11
> Question：
> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? When attending events and activities, taking too many photos affect people’s participation.

### 回答v1

Honestly, I agree with the statement. I think people taking too many photos affects people's participation. First of all, taking too many photos, uh, taking photos itself uh, affects our feelings of uh, during the events to have fun and relax. When taking photos, we need to be until uh, we, we, we can reduce ourselves. And it loses a lot of fun. Uh, secondly, uh, taking many photos affects our true feeling about um, about our, during our social interaction. So I think taking too many photos affects people's participation.

### 思路

- **感受**：影响观感
- **时间**：浪费时间
### Answer

 Honestly, I agree with the statement that if we take too many photos at an event, it really affects our participation. First off, I think taking photos could be very **distracting**. This is because nowadays we often use flash while taking photos. And you know, the flash is really strong and bright. So when we take photos, we may annoy other people because they can be distracted from their own conversation with their friends. Besides, I think that taking photos would take too much time. This is because while taking the picture, we have to think about the **composition**; we have to **zoom in or zoom out**. So if we **are preoccupied with** taking the pictures, we may ignore the people around us. Therefore, I agree with the statement that taking too many photos will affect our participation.

### 语言

1. distracting 使人分心的  
2. flash 闪光灯 
3. annoy 令人厌烦 
4. composition 构图 
5. zoom in/out 放大/缩小

## Exercise 4

> [!question]
> Some professors answer students’ questions at the end of a lecture, while other professors prefer to answer questions in the middle of the lecture when they come up. Which approach is better and why?

### 回答v1

Honestly, I agree with the statement that the professor should answer students' questions at the end of a lecture. First of all, this can save time of the class. This is because students' questions will usually be mentioned at the rest of the class, so it can avoid a lot of unnecessary explanations. Second, answering students' question at the end of a lecture can meet the initial need means of the students. It can actually explain what the students really need and does improve efficiency there. For professor should answer students' questions at the end of a lecture.

### 思路

1. 万能理由：节省时间；统一解答问答，避免重复讲同样的内容
2. 万能理由：学习；实现教学目标；可能会忘记教学目标，导致重点的遗漏。
### Answer

Well, I think the professor should answer questions at the end of the class. First off, it really saves time. This is because the answer to some of the student's questions could **reveal itself later in the lecture**, like maybe in the second half of the lecture through discussions or professor's examples. So by answering questions at the end, the professor can avoid **wasting time on repeating the same thing over and over again**. Besides, answering questions at the end of the lecture can help professor to achieve the learning outcome. This is because if the questions interrupts the professor's teaching, he may **lose his train of thought and he may forget mentioning some key points**. So by answering questions at the end can make sure the professor can cover everything. Therefore, I think it is better to answer questions at the end of the class.

### 语言

1. reveal itself 自己揭晓、显露出来 
2. second-half 后半段 
3. waste time on (doing) something 浪费时间做某事 
4. achieve learning objectives 实现教学目标 
5. lose train of thought 打断思路 
6. mention 提到

## Exercise 5

> [!question]
> Question：
> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? Schools should not allow students to use calculators during math exams.

Honestly, I disagree with the statement. I think that students should be allowed to use calculators during math exams. Firstly, it saves time. This is because if not using calculators, students will waste a lot of time calculating simple digits over and over again. So by allowing students to use calculators during math exams, schools can actually evaluate the true ability of students to analyze the math problems. Secondly, it can meet the actual needs. By allowing students to use calculators during math exams, schools can encourage students to make full use of the calculator, thus improving their problem-solving skills. Therefore, I think that students should be allowed to use calculators during math exams.

## Exercise 6

> [!question]
> Do you think the government should give financial support to build museums and theatres? Explain why.


### Answer

Honestly, I think the government should give money to build museums and theaters. First off, this can **create job opportunities**. This is because while building these places, you need to hire a lot of **construction workers**. And after the place is built, hundreds or even thousands of people would be working there. So people in town could find good jobs and **support themselves**. Besides, I think museums is an important place for us to learn history. This is because they collect and **preserve** important things from the past and **put them on display**, like paintings or even jewelry. So by looking at these objects, we can **have a sense of pride in our own culture**. Therefore, the government should build museums and theaters.

### 回答v1

### Answer

Honestly, when facing with problems, I would like to keep my sense of humor. First off, it brings me **courage**. This is because humor brings laughter, and laughter can **take away my fear**. In this case, I can face to the problems directly and try to sail through them. Besides, I would like to keep my sense of humor because it can help me to become more creative. This is because humor can totally reduce my anxiety. It can help me to **loosen up**. In this case, I can try to **energize my thinking** and try to be creative and **think outside of the box**. So because of these two reasons, I would like to keep my sense of humor when facing problems.

## Exercise 8

> [!note] Question
> Some people like to purchase the product they like as soon as it is available, while some prefer to wait until the price of the product becomes more affordable. Which do you prefer?

Honestly, I wouldn't buy a product **at launch**. I would wait a little bit. First off, I can save money. This is because companies usually **charge a premium** on new products, and if I wait a little bit, the price will become cheaper, like by 20 or even 30%. So this is very important to me because I **live on a tight budget**. Besides, I would like to wait a little bit because I want to avoid mistakes. This is because while waiting I can **read reviews** about this product. I can find out whether the product **delivers on its promises**, whether the product is reliable or not. In this case, I can make sure the money is well spent. Therefore, I would like to wait a little bit.
