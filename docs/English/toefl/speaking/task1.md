### 回答v2

From my point of view, I disagree that it is necessary to protect children from learning about difficulties in life. First of all, they can face the difficulties in life tougher and can be mentally prepared. Secondly, they can learn methods to face the difficulties in life, such as thinking outside of the box and to be persistent. Therefore, I think children should learn about difficulties in life.

### 范例

Honestly, **I disagree with the statement. I think parents should let children learn about difficulties in life at an early age.** First off, this can make kids tougher. This is because by letting children **go through the difficulties** in life, they can be mentally prepared that they will know life itself is hard, so they are better able to **take on the challenges** in the future, and they can **sail through different problems**. Besides, by letting children go through difficulties in life, they can learn how to solve the problems. They can improve their **problem solving skills**. This is because they can learn how to **come up with different ideas**, how to think outside of the box. In this case, they can solve all the challenges they face. Therefore, I disagree with the statement.

Children can be mentally prepared and become tougher by learning about difficulties in life. Furthermore, children can learn to solve different problems, so they can come up with different ideas and think outside of the box. Therefore, I disagree with the statement.

> Your professor is asking you to help with some research work on the weekend, but you have planned to go back to hometown to attend your sister’s birthday party. Which would you choose to do?

### 回答v1

In this case, I want to choose to attend my sister's birthday party. First of all, I think my sister's birthday party symbolizes the relationship and love in the family, and I think this is of the most priority. Secondly, I think the research work on the weekend isn't very suitable. <font color="#ff0000">Uh, it isn't very suitable.</font> And I think my professor is, uh, easy to communicate with. Therefore, I think I will choose my sister's birthday party first as to show my love for my sister.

### 思路

**时间冲突类；**

- 万能理由1：家人：家人最重要
- 万能理由2：感受：有意思的活动，放松身心，可以投入将来的活动中去。
### 范例

Honestly, I would choose to attend my sister's birthday party. First off, I think **family should always come first**. This is because my sister and my other family members have **loved me and supported me unconditionally**. They have been through a lot of difficulties with me and helped me during those times. So you know, on this important birthday, I will definitely **be there for my sister** to celebrate with her. Besides, I would like to go to the birthday party because I need to **relax and unwind**. This is because I'm really stressed during the week and on the birthday parties I can do something fun, like **singing karaoke or blowing the candles together** with my sister. So this can help me to **forget about all the troubles and stress**. Therefore, I would like to attend this birthday party.

### 语言

## Exercise 3

> [!note] 2025.1.11
> Question：
> Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? When attending events and activities, taking too many photos affect people’s participation.

### 回答v1

Honestly, I agree with the statement. I think people taking too many photos affects people's participation. First of all, taking too many photos, uh, taking photos itself uh, affects our feelings of uh, during the events to have fun and relax. When taking photos, we need to be until uh, we, we, we can reduce ourselves. And it loses a lot of fun. Uh, secondly, uh, taking many photos affects our true feeling about um, about our, during our social interaction. So I think taking too many photos affects people's participation.

### 思路

- **感受**：影响观感
- **时间**：浪费时间
### Answer

 Honestly, I agree with the statement that if we take too many photos at an event, it really affects our participation. First off, I think taking photos could be very **distracting**. This is because nowadays we often use flash while taking photos. And you know, the flash is really strong and bright. So when we take photos, we may annoy other people because they can be distracted from their own conversation with their friends. Besides, I think that taking photos would take too much time. This is because while taking the picture, we have to think about the **composition**; we have to **zoom in or zoom out**. So if we **are preoccupied with** taking the pictures, we may ignore the people around us. Therefore, I agree with the statement that taking too many photos will affect our participation.

### 语言

1. distracting 使人分心的  
2. flash 闪光灯 
3. annoy 令人厌烦 
4. composition 构图 
5. zoom in/out 放大/缩小 
6. be preoccupied with 全神贯注于某事
