## 解决困难

how to **come up with different ideas**, how to think outside of the box

## 家庭

This is because my sister and my other family members have **loved me and supported me unconditionally**. They have been through a lot of difficulties with me and helped me during those times. 

 So you know, on this important birthday, I will definitely **be there for my sister** to celebrate with her. 

## 放松/娱乐

This is because I'm really stressed during the week and on the birthday parties I can do something fun, like **singing karaoke or blowing the candles together** with my sister. So this can help me to **forget about all the troubles and stress**.

## 理由

save time

金钱 -> 就业
