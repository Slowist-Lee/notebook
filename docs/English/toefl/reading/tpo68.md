> Venice manipulated markets by controlling production. In the late thirteenth century, wishing to  raise the world market price, Venice had all saltworks on the Greek island of Crete destroyed, and it  banned the local production of salt. The Venetians then brought in all the salt needed for local  consumption, built stores to sell the imported salt, and paid damages to the owners of the saltworks.  The policy was designed to control prices and at the same time keep the locals happy. Aiding its  ability to **ruthlessly** manipulate commerce and control territory, Venice maintained the ships of the  merchant fleet as a naval reserve and called them into combat when needed. The Venetian fleet  patrolled the Adriatic Sea, stopped ships, inspected cargo, and demanded licensing documents to  make sure all commercial traffic was conforming with its regulations.

> [!check]- Answer
> 首先，我们来拆解一下原文中高亮句子的核心信息：
> 
> *   **谁 (Who):** 美国地质调查局的科学家，他们来自火山灾害援助计划（VDAP），驻地在华盛顿州温哥华的喀斯开火山观测站。
> *   **做什么 (What):** 他们随时待命（always on call），准备好在接到通知后立即（at a moment's notice）赶往世界任何地方（anywhere in the world）正在苏醒的火山。
> *   **用什么 (With what):** 他们配备了最新的设备，如激光器、地震仪和其他监测设备。
> *   **为什么 (Why):** 他们的目的是评估火山的潜在暴力程度（potential for violence）并预测它何时可能喷发（predict when it might ignite）。
> 
> 现在我们逐一分析每个选项：
> 
> **选项 A 的问题:**
> *   "are always being asked to rush somewhere" (总是被要求赶往某地) 这个表述不准确。原文是 "are always on call, ready when summoned" (随时待命，一旦被召唤就准备好出发)，强调的是他们的准备状态和随时响应的能力，而不是一个持续不断的“被要求”的动作。
> *   "...predict when a volcano is likely to awake" (预测火山何时可能苏醒) 这与原文不符。原文说他们去的是 "an awakening volcano" (一个正在苏醒的火山)，他们的任务是预测它何时会“喷发”（ignite），而不是预测它何时“苏醒”。
> *   "...what damage it could do" (它会造成什么损害) 这也不是原文的直接信息。原文是评估 "the volcano's potential for violence" (火山的潜在暴力程度)，这与具体的“损害”评估有细微差别，原文更侧重于火山本身爆发的强度。
> 
> **选项 C 的问题:**
> *   这个选项完全曲解了科学家的目的。它说科学家这么做是为了 "to learn how to predict" (为了学习如何预测)。但原文明确指出，他们是已经具备专业知识的专家，去现场的目的是应用他们的技能来 "assess" (评估) 和 "predict" (预测) 一个特定火山的活动，而不是去学习。他们的行动是应用，而不是学习。
> 
> **选项 D 的问题:**
> *   这个选项改变了工作的范围和流程。它说科学家们 "use in assessing volcanoes worldwide to predict which of them will erupt violently" (在全球范围内评估火山，以预测它们中的哪一个会猛烈喷发)。这听起来像是一个持续的、全球性的普查工作，试图从所有火山中筛选出可能喷发的那个。而原文描述的是一个响应机制：当一个特定的火山**已经开始苏醒 (an awakening volcano)** 时，他们才会被召唤出动，针对这个特定的火山进行评估。原文的行动是“被动的、响应式的”，而选项D描述成了“主动的、普遍性的”。
> 
> **为什么选项 B 是最佳答案:**
> *   **"Armed with the latest technology..."** (配备了最新的技术) 对应原文的 "...armed with the latest in lasers, sesmometers, and other monitoring devices..."。
> *   **"...US Geological Survey scientists from the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program are always available to go anywhere in the world..."** (来自火山灾害援助计划的美国地质调查局科学家随时可以前往世界任何地方) 完美对应了原文的 "Scientists from the Volcano Disaster Assistance Program (VDAP)-part of the US. Geological Survey...are always on call, ready when summoned to rush...to an awakening volcano anywhere in the worid"。
> *   **"...to assess whether, and when, an awakening volcano will erupt."** (去评估一个正在苏醒的火山是否会以及何时会喷发) 这准确地概括了原文的 "...assess the volcano's potential for violence and predict when it might ignite"。评估其“潜在暴力程度”就是判断它是否会猛烈喷发（whether），而预测“何时点燃”就是判断“何时喷发”（when）。
> 
> **结论:**
> 选项B最准确、最完整地保留了原始句子的所有核心信息，没有歪曲事实或遗漏关键点。而选项A、C、D都在不同程度上改变了原文的含义，或是错误地描述了科学家的工作性质、目的或范围。

> 
> *   **A. emphasize the decisive role of new technology in accurately predicting when a volcano is likely to erupt** (强调新技术在精确预测火山何时可能喷发中的决定性作用。)
> *   虽然文章提到了“灵敏的设备”，但重点并非强调技术的“新旧”或“决定性作用”。文章的重点是**通过技术获得了什么数据**（岩浆上升速率）以及**这个数据有什么用**（预测时间）。圣海伦火山的例子是用来证明这个“数据”的有效性，而不是为了笼统地赞美“新技术”。这个选项过于宽泛和笼统。

> 
> **为什么选项 B 是错误的？**
> 
> *   **B. illustrate the effectiveness of tilt meters in predicting volcanic eruptions** (说明倾斜仪在预测火山喷发中的有效性。)
> *   这是一个明显的错误。倾斜仪（tilt meter）是在文章的**前半部分**提到的，用于检测火山斜坡的“膨胀”（bulging）。而圣海伦火山的例子是在文章的**后半部分**，紧跟在讨论“谐波震颤”和“岩浆上升速率”之后。这个例子支撑的是后一个观点，与倾斜仪无关。
>

> **为什么选项 C 是错误的？**
> 
> *   **C. provide an example of how monitoring certain distinctive patterns of earthquake activity can provide a reliable indication of where an eruption will occur** (提供一个例子，说明监测特定的地震活动模式如何能可靠地指示喷发将**在哪里**发生。)
> *   这个选项非常具有迷惑性，但它错在一个关键的词上：“**where**”（在哪里）。
> *   我们再看原文，文章说通过监测地震可以估计**“when” (何时)** 喷发。圣海伦火山的例子也是用来证明预测**时间**的准确性。虽然文章前面提到可以监测“the location where these tremors occur”（震颤发生的位置），但这并不是圣海伦火山这个例子直接证明的观点。这个例子直接证明的是它紧挨着的前一句话——关于预测 **“何时 (when)”** 喷发的观点。因此，C选项将预测的内容从“时间”偷换概念到了“地点”，这是它错误的核心原因。
> 
> **总结：**
> 圣海伦火山的例子是一个具体的证据，用来支持一个特定的论点。要找到正确答案，就必须准确识别这个例子直接支持的是哪一个论点。通过分析句子结构和代词“it”的指向，我们可以确定它支持的是“岩浆上升速率可以预测喷发**时间**”这一论点，这与选项D完全吻合。

> Geologists have enjoyed fair success in predicting individual eruptive episodes when they concentrate on a specific volcano after an eruptive phase has begun. These monitoring efforts involve carefully measuring changes in a volcano's surface temperature, watching for the slightest expansion in its slope, and keeping track of regional earthquake activity. A laboratory at the University of Washington in Seattle is staffed 24 hours a day to monitor the rumblings of Mount St. Helens. Even with the advances brought by today's technology, however, the art of volcano prediction has not been fully mastered. The US. Geological Survey missed the call on Mount St. Helens' 1980 blast despite the fact that the mountain was being watched closely by a large team of scientists armed with the latest in prediction technology. lt did successfully predict the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines evacuating virtually everyone within 25 kilometers (15 miles) before the volcano's powerful blast on May 17,1991.
> 
> 
> 
> Before a volcano erupts, hot magma rises toward the surface, so any local manifestation of increasing heat may signal an impending event. Ongoing surveys can identify new surface hot springs and take the temperature of the water and steam in existing ones. lf the escaping steam isn't much hotter than the boiling point of water, then surface water is probably seeping into the mountain and being heated by contact with hot subsurface rocks, and all is well for the time being. If the steam is superheated, with temperatures as high as 500°C(900°F),then it probably derives from shallow watern'ch magma, a sign that an eruption may be brewing. As magma rises, the volcanic cone itself begins to heat up.The overall temperatur of a volcanic cone can be monitored from an orbiting satellite equipped with infrared heat sensors to detect the slightest change in surface temperature. This high-altitude technology serves as a simultaneous early-warning system for most of Earths 600 or so active volcanoes. lmpending eruptions may also be predicted by increased gas emissions from rising magmas. For this reason, volcanologists continuously monitor sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions from potentially active volcanoes.

> Efforts to predict eruptions are thwarted, however, when we are unaware of a site's volcanic potential. Occasionally, a new volcano appears suddenly and rather unexpectedly, as was the case in 1943, when the volcano Paricutin developed literally aovernight in the Mexican state of Michoacan, 320 kilometers (200 miles) west of Mexico City. The surrounding area was known to be volcanic because of its geologic zone, but it was not possible to predict that the volcano would appear at this particular site. Our ability to predict volcanic eruptions continues to improve but is not yet as accurate as we need it to be.

> [!question]+ Question
> A. Because hot magma rises toward the surface before a volcano erupts, an increase in heat, as well as increased emissions near a potentially active volcano, can signal a coming eruption.
> B. Orbiting satellites equipped with the latest high altitude technology have now replaced ground-based early-warning systems for all but a few of the Earth's known active volcanoes.
> C. Since rising magma enlarges fractures and pushes aside fractured rock, it causes a distinctive type of earthquake, which often signals eruptions.
> D. The sudden appearance of new surface hot springs on the slope of a potentially active volcano is a strong indication that an eruption at that site is likely to occur soon.
> E. New bulges on a volcano's slop may signal an impending eruption because volcanoes expand as magma rises up into them, and the speed of the rise indicates when an eruption may occur.
