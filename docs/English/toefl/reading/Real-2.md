> [!note]+ Paragraph
> Some scientists think that two of Jupiter's four large ("Galilean") moons, lo and Europa, may be candidates for hosting life-in part because both of them have two important preconditions, water and an energy source. lo is similar to the rocky inner planets (such as Earth and Mars) in its composition, having an iron core and large amounts of silicon. Proximity to Jupiter makes it far more geologically dynamic than any other planet or moon. Tidal forces- caused by the gravitational effects of Jupiter and other moons-deform lo as it passes through its orbit. The process heats the moon, and constant volcanism results as the surface crust fails to keep in the sloshing magma (liquefied rock) underneath. The surface can change up to a hundred meters between high and low tide in some places. Other than Earth, lo is the only object in the solar system known to have currently active volcanoes. Eruptions wipe out all evidence of meteoric impacts; no craters can be seen on the surface.

> The second nearest of the Galilean satellites is Europa. In many respects it resembles lo, but its composition is radically different. Europa possesses large quantities of water, either as ice or as a liquid. Massive tides warm Europa, though they are only about one-tenth as strong as the ones affecting lo. On this moon, the tides probably maintain an extensive ocean under the sea ice. Several lines of evidence point to liquid water. Planetary scientists were surprised to discover that very few large craters exist on the surface. Some process must be resurfacing the planet on a regular basis, leading many to believe that liquid water spills out. Second, the Galileo spacecraft detected a magnetic field induced by Jupiter. Some conducting material must be present around the inside of the planet. Liquid water with salts seems the most likely solution. Finally, the mass and size of Europa are consistent with an ice-and-water mixture.

> [!question]+ Question
> Which of the following can be inferred from paragraph 3 about the presence of life on Europa?
> A. Life on Europa would be more likely if a conductive material like salt were present in the water.
> B. Jupiter's magnetic field may be too strong to support life on Europa.
> C. Europa is more likely than lo to be capable of supporting life
> D. Any life on Europa would likely be found on its surface, not in its ocean.

> Paragraph 3 mentions that Europa's "Massive tides warm Europa, though they are only about one-tenth as strong as the ones affecting Io." This directly contrasts Europa's tidal heating with Io's. In paragraph 2, it is stated that Io "seems, however, to have too much energy to make a good habitat for life" and "Life as we know it would quickly dissolve on the surface of Io." By stating that Europa's tidal forces are significantly weaker than Io's (and thus, by implication, its energy is less extreme), and focusing on the presence of liquid water (a key precondition for life), paragraph 3, in the context of the entire passage, implies that Europa is a more plausible candidate for life compared to Io, which was dismissed as too energetic.
