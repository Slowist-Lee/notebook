> [!note]+ Paragraph
> The situation was different in the Chinese Han Empire(206b.c.e.220a.d., where metalworkers using more advanced furnaces had identified the natural compounds that created better-quality iron during the smelting process. Through continual practice they had refined the measurements needed to ensure that the compounds added to iron ore introduced sufficient carbon to create a reliable quality of steel. The Chinese had developed large enclosed furnaces that included bamboo nozzles (round openings) to produce steady streams of air. This made it easier to keep the fire at a steady heat and control reactions within the furnace. Chinese furnaces also burned compressed coal, which further increased temperatures and reduced fuel costs. This was significant because mass-produced cast iron (iron with carbon content greater than 2 percent)could be transformed into steel by applying blasts of cool air that provided oxygen to the molten metal (the"Hundred Refinings Method"). The Chinese also knew how to turn wrought iron into steel. **Blades were wrapped in fruit skins rich in carbon containing a small amount of impurities. These packages were then sealed in clay containers and heated at high temperatures over a sustained period(up to twenty-four hours) until the metal absorbed the necessary carbon and strengthening elements** . In China, these techniques were used to mass-manufacture a variety of tools, including knives, hammers, and cooking pots.

> [!question]+ Question
> According to paragraph 2, the purpose of wrapping blades with fruit skins was to
> A. keep cool air from reaching the blades while they were hot
> B. increase the blades' strength with additional carbon
> C. protect the blades while tools were being manufactured
> D. prevent clay and other impurities from affecting the blades

> [!check]- Answer
> 不要看错，是 **rich in carbon containing a small amount of impurities**。 所以后面也相应写的是 **until the metal absorbed the necessary carbon and strengthening elements**。 所以很自然是B.

> Sulfuric acid aerosols are also a major factor in the destruction of the ozone layer, which occupies the lower part of the stratosphere. ==A== For example, the Pinatubo eruption is estimated to have caused a 15 to 25 percent decrease in ozone in the high latitudes. ==B== Whether or not this is the mechanism, it is known that less ozone results in lower temperatures.Exactly how the aerosol affects ozone is not precisely known. ==C== One possibility is that the droplets provide sites for the breakdown of otherwise inert chlorine compounds and in that way enhance the formation of atomic chlorine, which is known to destroy ozone. ==D==

> [!question]+ Question
> Look at the four squares  that indicate where the following sentence could be added to the passage.
> 
> **Whether or not this is the mechanism, it is known that less ozone results in lower temperatures.**
> 
> Where would the sentence best fit? Click on a square  to add the sentence to the passage

> [!check]- Answer
> Key: 这句话是总结句，这段话前面论述了 Sulfuric acid aerosols are also a major factor in the destruction of the ozone layer， 所以后面讲完 One possibility 之后就需要总结这个  less ozone results in lower temperatures.
> 所以答案是D
> 这句话实际上和这段话的关系都不大，只是为了不离题，所以联系都不紧密，因此难度还挺大的
