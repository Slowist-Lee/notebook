# Academic Writing

## 一、题型分类

- 第一步：读题：简单地提炼两位Student的观点
### Category 1: Comparison

> [!EXAMPLE] Sample 1
> Which approach do you think is better:  assessing students based only on their  performance, or also based on their effort?
> 
> Student 1  
I believe grading shall primarily be based on students’ performance, but hard effort should also be considered. Students **learn something** from their hard work even if they do not score so well in tests, which **will benefit them in their future life**.
> 
>Student 2  
Well, only performance should be considered. It is the only **fair** solution. Why should those who submit incorrect answers on their homework get the same score as I do? The so-called hard work is not relevant.

### Category 2: Evaluation

> [!EXAMPLE] Sample 2
> Write a post responding to the professor’s question.
> In your response, you should:
> - express and support your opinion.
>- make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.
>An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
>
>**Professor** Today, we are going to discuss the transition of new graduates into university. Many new high-school graduates work, travel, or just relax for some time before they attend university, and some even take a whole year – namely the gap year. Some say they have benefited greatly from their gap year, while others say it is a waste of time. **What is your opinion on gap year? Does it bring more advantages of disadvantages to students?**
>**Student 1** I am completely up for gap year. It is a great chance for students to **reflect on what they are going to study** in the future. They can have **hands-on experience of different fields and witness the world** in their own eyes.
>**Student 2** We need to **finish university as soon as possible** or we are wasting money. Tuition, rent, books, and everything are becoming **more expensive** every year. The money students can make in a gap year will not be able to cove the extra money to be paid later.


### Category 3: Argument & Solution

Argument - Yes? No?

do you think ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make?

Will people have more free time and be able to enjoy more leisure activities in the future?

> [!EXAMPLE] Sample 3
> Write a post responding to the professor’s question.
> In your response, you should:
> - express and support your opinion.
> - make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.
>An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
>
>**Professor** Today we will cover the business concept of employment retention and training. Even if we are able to hire the best skilled workers from the job market, businesses still need to help them develop their skills in this fast-paced society. So managers usually need to decide on what and how much training to be given to the employees. In your opinion, **do you think ongoing job training is the most important investment a business can make?**
>
>**Student 1** I totally disagree with such a statement. Companies can simply find and hire the best employees from the job market. There are many aspects in which companies need to spend their money on, and we need to save money from training.
>
>**Student 2** Training is essential to employment retention. In other words, we need to make every effort to make employees stay. Through training, employees will feel that they are valued by the company, and will thus want to stay.

### Category 4: Solution 类

> [!EXAMPLE] Sample 4
> Write a post responding to the professor’s question.
> In your response, you should:
> - express and support your opinion.
> - make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.
>An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
>
>**Professor** In this lecture, we will look into how modern consumers buy tech products. Today, when people need a tech product, such as a tablet or mobile phone, they usually find that they do not have adequate information to make the purchasing decision. In this discussion, please let us know **what do you think is the biggest mistake that people make when it comes to the purchase of tech products**. Please explain what this mistake is and why.
>
>**Student 1** The biggest issue is that people do not match what they need and what they buy. For example, my friend got the latest release of a laptop but found that he did not need much of the fancy functions. He actually paid for what he does not need.
>
>**Student 2** I think people tend to forget about **the software**. When people buy tech products, they might ignore the software that come with the hardware. For example, it might be challenging to learn a new operating system on a laptop.

## 二、文章结构

### Structure 1 : Elaboration + Example + Concession

> 比较泛的议题，可以more specific.

**Structure 1**: 
- **Point & Elaboration**
- **Further Elaboration** 
- **Example**
- **Consession**

> [!EXAMPLE] 例子
> **I believe** grading shall focus on students' performance on assignments and tests （观点）, **since** <u>it is the most effective way to measure the progress in their study</u>. （解释）(27)
> 
> ---
> 进一步解释：
> 
> **To be more specific**, performance on assignments and tests <u>best reflect students' understanding of academic concepts and their problem-solving skills</u>, **which are** also the objective of most courses. (29)
> 
> ---
> 举例：
> 
> **For example,** the score on a mathematics test indicates if the student has completely understood formulas and theories, and if they can apply them in various conditions. (27)
> 
> ---
> 构建一个让步：
> **Still,** some might claim that students learn something beneficial to their life through their hard effort regardless of the performance. **However,** we all need to learn from our mistakes and correct them in time, instead of persisting on wrong ideas or approaches. （20+22）
> 
> $\rightarrow$ 需要说明“更好”

### Structure 2 : Two points & Elaboration

**Structure 2:** Point & Elaboration + Further Elaboration + Second Point & Elaboration + Further Elaboration

> [!EXAMPLE] 例子
> 
>**Point 1:**
>**I believe** gap year will greatly promote students' academic development **as** students can deepen their understanding in their future field of study. (23)
>**To elaborate,** practical experience during the gap year will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing impractical imagination based on their limited experience, **building** a real passion in their future pursuit. (36)
>
>---
>**Point 2:**
>**Moreover,** the experience of communicating with people from various backgrounds through a job or during a trip will greatly enhance students' social skills, which are essential in their future study. (31)
>**To be more specific,** students will be able to exchange ideas accurately and smoothly with other students and professors in lectures, group discussions and projects, **which** promotes an effective learning experience. (32)

### Structure 3 : Comparison and Contrast

>结构：Point + Elaboration/Example（往往是Substantion） + （相反的）Point + Example + (Conclusion)

#### Example 1
**I agree that the Internet has brought great convenience for individuals to get access to large amounts of information.** It becomes extremely convenient for travelers, for example, to search information about local cuisine by logging on the Internet when they first visit a city. Local residents can also be greatly benefited from the Internet by knowing the closest community center and hospitals. **By contrast**, all the convenience were impossible before the Internet first came into our daily life. Travelers had to carry with them a load of travel information and local residents had to ask other people for the information. **Without the Internet, it will be much troublesome for people to obtain the information they need.**

#### Example 2

- change 不一定是improve 或者 decline

**I think the working conditions for workers has been remarkably changed in recent years.** **Traditionally,** workers were permanently employed. They were valued for their adequate knowledge of their work and rewarded with steady salary raises and favorable medical insurance. **In contrast**, in today’s increasingly competitive marketplace, employers are less interested in having their payrolls burdened by paying top salaries to their long-serving employees. As a result, workers always sign temporary contracts, struggle with the sharp decline in their social welfare benefits, and prepare for layoffs, all of which lead to their precarious situation.

## 三、具体写法 - 以Structure 1为例

### 3.1 Point & Elaboration

**Common Points in Education:**
1. Academic development / Effectiveness of study — 学业
2. Personal development / Career development — 发展（个人、职业）
3. Teamworking and communication skills — 团队合作、沟通

- I believe that … / I firmly hold the idea that … / In my opinion, … / As far as I am concerned, … / It is obvious that …

正述观点后置论据
1. Practical experience will greatly promote / hinder students' academic development **as** they can deepen their understanding in their field of study. (25)
2. The overuse of technology will have a positive / negative impact on our personal development **since** it will hinder our independent thinking. (29)
3. We shall definitely prioritize economic development over environmental protection **due to the fact that** a stable economy is the very foundation of social, scientific, and industrial development. (31)

前置论据后述观点
4. The fact that discussion involves active exchange of ideas between participants **indicates that** such style of learning drives us to strengthen our communication skills. ( )

例如：

I think score is good for students because they learn knowledge.
$\downarrow$
**I believe** grading shall focus on students' performance on assignments and tests **since** it is the most effective way to measure the progress in their study. (27)

I believe effort is important because experience is good.
$\downarrow$
**In my opinion,** effort is an important element to be considered in study and grading **due to the fact that** students learn from both what they have done right and what they have done wrong. (31)

#### Elaboration

- To be more specific / To elaborate / In other words / More specifically / To explain it further...

Why effective? How effective? What effective?

**To be more specific,** during a discussion, students not only have to come up with their own thoughts but also consider those from others, **which stimulates an active way of thinking**.

**To elaborate,** practical experience will help students witness the true nature of a job instead of developing some random imagination based on their limited experience, **developing a real passion in their field of study**.

**In other words,** **it is** only in a prosperous, stable, and developed society **that** we can allocate extra resources to implement the protection of the environment.

**More specifically,** **instead of** thinking and analyzing a problem, people might rely on technology to search for quick answers to every question they have in life and study.

### 3.2 Example

<u>Topic: Electronic devices help students on their study.</u>

> [!IMPORTANT] Example  的 三个要点
> 1. Focused on topic
> 2. Factual illustration
> 3. Good language

#### Type 1 - Substantiation
**For example,** the score on a mathematics test indicates if the student has completely understood formulas and theories, and if they can apply them in various conditions. 
#### Type 2 - Story Telling

> 起因+经过+结果 - for more detail

> [!EXAMPLE]
> For instance, one of my best learning experience was an internship before college with the Ford Car Company. The experience from the manufacturing floor helped me understand key concepts in car production and problems to be solved. (18+18)

For instance, last week, my little niece had a homework <font color="#ff0000">from her biology class</font> .
She used her mobile phone to search for <font color="#ff0000">diverse</font> information on the internet. 
Finally, she got a good grade<font color="#ff0000"> for the excellent work.</font>

> [!NOTE] 还可以改善:
> For instance, last week, my little niece had a homework **from her biology class about animal behaviors.** (17)
> **Instead of relying on limited knowledge on books**, she used her mobile phone to search for **diverse** information on the internet, **including why and how animals play, which earned her a good grade for the excellent work**. (37)


#### Exercises
##### Ongoing job training:
For example, the company I work for occasionally organize training on how to use the ERP (enterprise resource planning) system. Through utilizing ERP, different departments get a much better understanding of the operation of the whole organization, thus building a stronger synergy between departments and individuals. (20+26)
#### Buying tech products:
<font color="#7f7f7f">The biggest mistake in the purchase of tech products is that consumers almost always pay for what they do not need since people are easily misled by advertisements. (28)</font>
<font color="#7f7f7f">To elaborate, TV and internet commercials usually illustrate the most sophisticated and powerful functions of high-tech products in an exaggerated manner, which are unfortunately rarely needed. (26)</font>
For example, commercials may demonstrate how a powerful laptop may solve all problems in our work and life, while we end up just using the expensive laptop with basic jobs such as editing texts and PowerPoint slides. (37)

### 3.3 Concession
组成：concession+refutation

> [!EXAMPLE] 
> Still, some might claim that students learn something beneficial to their life through their hard effort regardless of the performance. However, we all need to learn from our mistakes and correct them in time, instead of persisting on wrong ideas or approaches. (20+22)

> [!EXAMPLE] 
Still, a voice arises that the cost of attending college rises each year, and we need to start college life as soon as possible. Ironically, such cost is nothing compared with the life-long regret of studying a wrong major. (24+15)

> [!EXAMPLE] 
**Nevertheless,** some might claim that students learn something beneficial to their life through their hard effort regardless of the performance. **However,** we all need to learn from our mistakes and correct them in time, instead of persisting on wrong ideas or approaches. (20+22)

> [!EXAMPLE] 
**Still, a voice arises that** the cost of attending college rises each year, and we need to start college life as soon as possible. **Ironically,** such cost is nothing compared with the life-long regret of studying a wrong major. (23+15)

> [!EXAMPLE] 
Still, a voice arises that businesses can save money from training by recruiting new employees. Ironically, even the most talented and skilled new employees will need time and training to best adapt themselves to a new environment, which is a lot of times more expensive than ongoing job training. (15+34)

> [!IMPORTANT] Slightly Different Example
**I understand Rachel's concern over the funding of the libraries but I believe she misses a critical point.** A strong and healthy body is the prerequisite for students to make full use of the resources in libraries and study concentratedly, which means that the significance of sports and athletic programs cannot be neglected. 

> [!IMPORTANT] Example
**In conclusion**, **while** sports programs have their place in promoting physical health and fostering school spirit, universities should prioritize funding for academic facilities <u>to ensure that they fulfill their primary mission in education. This approach will benefit the entire university and contribute to the institution’s overall success.</u>
