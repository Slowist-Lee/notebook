# 综合写作

现在你将作为一个教授托福（TOEFL）考试的英语老师，来帮助我修改我的托福作文，提升我的写作方面的表现。
这是我的写作任务内容：
我要读一篇reading passage，听一篇lecture，并summarize the points made in the lecture, being sure to explain how they challenge/cast doubts on the specific methods discussed in the reading passage. (An effective response will usually contain 175-225 words.)

这是我需要你帮助我的地方：
1. 你要根据我提供给你的评分标准和题目，对我的回答进行打分，分为2个维度：内容和表达（单项满分5分）
2. 你要列举出我的文章里出现的所有的语言errors that are present result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections. 并且告诉我为什么我的表达和给出的材料里的信息点是不一致的（比如说是因为我的word choice或者是语法导致我的回答里的表达改变了原文信息点的意思，或者没能清晰地表达出原文的意思），并且提出修改的意见。
3. 你要列举出我的回答里所有syntactic structures and grammatical structures的错误，并解释我错误的原因，告诉我正确的表达（你需要确保你提供给我的内容都符合学术语境中的表达，NO online slangs or informal expressions，也请把我的表达中不够正式的部分挑出来，告诉我更正式、学术的表达）
4. 你需要评估我整篇文章的结构对于一个not already familiar with the reading and the lecture的读者来说是否是足够清晰和易于理解的，并提供修改意见。

评分标准：
5分标准：
内容：successfully selects the important information from the lecture and coherently and accurately presents this information in relation to the relevant information presented in the reading.
表达：The response is well organized, and occasional language errors that are present do not result in inaccurate or imprecise presentation of content or connections.

4分标准：
内容：generally good in selecting the important information from the lecture and in coherently and accurately presenting this information in relation to the relevant information in the reading, but it may have minor omission, inaccuracy, vagueness, or imprecision of some content from the lecture or in connection to points made in the reading.
表达：Response is also scored at this level if it has more frequent or noticeable minor language errors, as long as such usage and grammatical structures do not result in anything more than an occasional lapse of clarity or in the connection of ideas.

3分标准：
内容：1. Although the overall response is definitely oriented to the task, it conveys only vague, global, unclear, or somewhat imprecise connection of the points made in the lecture to points made in the reading. 2. The response may omit one major key point made in the lecture or the reading, or connections between the two, may be incomplete, inaccurate, or imprecise.
表达：Errors of usage and/or grammar may be more frequent or may result in noticeably vague expressions or obscured meanings in conveying ideas and connections.

2分标准：
内容：1. The response significantly misrepresents or completely omits the overall connection between the lecture and the reading. 2. The response significantly omits or significantly misrepresents important points made in the lecture.
表达：The response contains language errors or expressions that largely obscure connections or meaning at key junctures or that would likely obscure understanding of key ideas for a reader not already familiar with the reading and the lecture.

1分标准：
内容：The response provides little or no meaningful or relevant coherent content from the lecture.
表达：The language level of the response is so low that it is difficult to derive meaning.

0分标准：
merely copies sentences from the reading, rejects the topic or is otherwise not connected to the topic; is written in a foreign language, consists of keystroke characters, or is blank.

这是阅读文本（reading passage）

The Northern Pacific sea star, which is native to the coasts of Japan, Korea, and China, has recently appeared thousands of kilometers away. Because this sea star now threatens to harm marine ecosystems in new and distant areas, scientists are currently investigating ways of controlling the spread of invasive Northern Pacific sea stars.

Quicklime

One method of reducing Northern Pacific sea star populations is by administering a poison called quicklime. Quicklime in its powdered form can be spread over large areas of the seafloor invaded by the sea stars. While quicklime destroys sea stars, it does not harm commercially important mollusks, such as oysters, scallops, and mussels, which are cultivated on the seafloor in many waters.

Introducing Parasites

A second strategy is to introduce parasites that naturally control the spread of Northern Pacific sea stars in their native habitat. One major reason why Northern Pacific sea star populations are flourishing in distant waters is the absence of natural enemies, such as parasites. In their native environment, male sea stars are infected by parasites that specifically attack their reproductive system. If these parasites became established in distant waters, invasive Northern Pacific sea star populations could be significantly decreased.

Treating Ballast Water

A third measure involves sterilizing ballast water. Ships that have unloaded their cargo take aboard some amount of sea water as a weight and balance stabilizer. This sea water is referred to as ballast water. Sea star larvae (immature sea stars) float freely in the sea and are often taken up in ballast pumps. After taking aboard ballast water with numerous larvae in Northerm Pacific waters, ships dump this water in ports thousands of kilometers away and thus contribute to the spread of these sea stars. If ships treated their ballast water with chemicals before releasing it in a different location, Northern Pacific sea stars could be prevented from spreading to new areas.

这里是听力文本（lecture）

Now listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about. Unfortunately, while the measures described in the reading will help, none will really stop invasive northern pacific sea stars from spreading. First, quick line doesn't hurt commercially important mollusks. That doesn't mean it's safe for the entire marine ecosystem. You see, this poison destroys not only invasive northern pacific sea stars, but also native ones. And native sea stars are critical to maintaining their local ecosystems. Once quick line is spread over the sea floor, it remains active there for a long time. And that'll be a problem for native sea stars. Soon after the quick line kills the invasive sea stars, native sea stars will move into the sea floor areas where the invasive sea stars used to live. And when that happens, they'll die too. Second, the idea of importing some of the northern pacific sea stars, natural enemies is unlikely to work as well as the reading would. Have you believe? The problem with parasites is that they do not completely destroy male northern pacific, sea stars, reproductive system. This means that male c stars infected with the parasite will still be able to fertilize the eggs of females. And given that a single female can produce up to 20 million eggs, it seems unlikely that introducing these parasites into habitats that the northern pacific c star has invaded will have much impact on the population of these sea stars. Finally, sterilizing the ballast water of ships is unlikely to prevent northern pacific c star larvae from spreading to new locations. Unfortunately, ballast water isn't the only way that c star larvae are transported from place to place while floating in the sea. Northern pacific c star larvae stick to objects around them. For example, to the bottom of small boats or to equipment used for fishing, because of their ability to stick to objects around them. Invasive northern pacific sea stars will likely continue to spread to new areas regardless of whether ships sterilize their ballast water or not. Summarize the points made in the lecture being sure to explain how they Challenge the specific methods discussed in the reading passage.

这是我的回答：
In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's method on how to control the spread of invasive Northern Pacific sea stars.  The professor asserts these methods won't really stop spreading.

To begin with, the professor argues that administering quicklime isn't safe to ecosystem. According to the reading passages, quicklime can destroy sea stars while protecting mollusks in seafloor. In opposition to the argument, the professors says that it will actually kill native one which is used to stay in the seafloor as well, which maintain the ecosystem.

Moreover, the professor claims that the strategy to introduce parasites might not work. The reading passage describes parasites can infect male sea stars by attacking their reproductive system. On the contrary, the professor states that since it only affects male ones, the female stars won't be affected, which produce 20 million eggs a year.

Finally, the professor rebuts the reading's point that sterilizing ballast water can prevent them from spreading to new areas, by stating that it isn't the only way for then to spread to new places. The professor points out stars are used to stick to the object around, such as ships. So they will spread from place to place whether there has ballast water or not.
