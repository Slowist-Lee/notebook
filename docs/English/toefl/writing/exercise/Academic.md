> While I appreciate the points made by Lisa and John, I attribute the increase in life expectancy primarily to changes in people's lifestyle habits. Nowadays, as we focus more and more on a healthy lifestyle, an increasing number of people are inclined to abandon our old, detrimental living habits like smoking, drinking and eating too much, shifting toward a more sustainable lifestyle characterized by regular exercise, nutritious diet and work-life balance. It is these changes that have contributed to a stronger body and better immune system, which is essential for effective defense against disease. While the progress in our medical technology is also conducive to longevity, it would be in vain if we do not care about our very own health and the healthy lifestyle habits. Therefore, I owe the extending life expectancy to the changes in our lifestyle habits.

> From my perspective, John has made a quite sounding point. I attribute the longevity to the well-developed and continuously-advancing public health system, boosting the wellbeing from infants to the elderly. Looking back to our childhood, we all received those varies anti-disease doses in the first years of our life. Now as a teenager, many of us are suggested to take some medical precautions against the HPV. The promotion of the public health system and the propaganda of health ideologies pushed our actions and raised the awareness of our health, contributing to lower disease rates and longer life expectancy. The medical technology mentioned by Lisa has made its devotion, but we should note that not all citizens are affordable for those high-techs. Does it mean that they'll definitely die earlier? 

## Exercise 2

> [!note] Sample 1
> I strongly agree with David’s idea that AI will help us deal with many serious problems currently affecting society. I’d add that AI has already been used to make driving safer and reduce car accidents, so we already have some proof that AI is helping people around the world. Megan raised the relevant point that AI could eliminate certain jobs, but she didn’t mention that AI is creating new jobs. For example, when new products are invented using AI they still have to be manufactured, which means that new factory jobs are created. Not only that, but AI learning tools can help people increase their skills and make themselves more attractive employees for various companies. Overall, then, I would say that AI will improve our lives.

> [!note] Sample 2
> The topic of AI has generated much discussion in recent years. I understand Megan’s concern over the risks that AI will bring, but I would like to add that it is impossible to stop the development of computer sciences, and all we can do is to explore how to better embrace the improvement of technology. I strongly agree with David’s idea that we must keep the AI on the right track. For instance, laws should be set up to regulate the use of AI, and companies in relevant fields can work together to communicate with the government to optimize the laws; the operators and users of AI should be taught the morality of how to use it in a proper way. In conclusion, AI is a good opportunity, instead of a threat to the future.

> [!note] Sample 3
> The topic of AI has generated much discussion in recent years. I think David has made a good point that AI is a great tool for today’s social progress. From my perspective, not only will AI help us deal with many obstacles with its strong analyzing ability, but also **assist scientists to explore more of the world**. Take volcano and deep-sea robots as an example. With new technologies, they can get into the most dangerous part of the earth easily, getting precious samples back to the lab for scientists to investigate and evaluate, without causing any harm to human explorers. Additionally, scientists can also use AI to identify certain materials, analyze them in research and apply them in practice, therefore promoting the development of the whole society with prominent science exploration which they were not able to achieve before.

outweigh: 比...更重/更重要

> [!note] Sample 4
> From my perspective, the advantages of AI far outweigh its disadvantages. To begin with, I totally agree with David’s opinion that AI has the potential to solve many global problems, and I’d add that the use of AI has also made our academic research much more convenient, thanks to its power to integrate information from the Internet. Take myself as an example. When I try to figure out where to find the latest development or former literature articles in a specific field of study, I always find AI an efficient tool since it has the ability to provide me with a comprehensive list of databases, professional journals and related websites. In contrast, before AI was invented, I had to spend hours sitting in front of the computer struggling to search for what I need for a project, followed by hours of sorting and filing. So AI has definitely made academic tasks easier for me and I believe it has the potential to change the way of researching in the future.


> [!note] Sample 5
> Lisa and John have raised good points on merits and demerits of AI. From my perspective, I prefer the idea considering AI a good tool to improve people’s lives. There is no denying of the fact that AI is developing in an unprecedentedly high speed, which means multiple and various possibility in the future. Thus, we will be able to solve loads of remained issues with the assistance of AI, for instance, to reorganize and improve city traffic, to do medical operation, even to predict environmental disasters and save lives. Never should we ignore the potential risks that AI has posed, but it doesn’t mean we should be scared and retreat. As long as we take right action and attitude towards AI, it can be a perfect tool to serve us and make a better future (140)

## Exercise 3 TPO74

> [!EXAMPLE] TPO 74
> Starting this week, we will discuss how public transportation is funded. Public transportation gives people from all social groups access to their homes, workplaces, and shopping. Some argue that public transportation should be supported by tax revenue so that all people could have free access to it. **What do you think? Should public transportation be free to all? Why or why not?**
>
>**Kelly** People already pay so much in taxes for things like schools, roads, and law enforcement. I don’t think that adding one more tax—especially when some people don’t even use public transportation—would be a good idea. People need money for other essentials for their families.
>
>**Paul** Free public transportation would result in having fewer cars on the roads. Also, it would mean cleaner air for the cities, and there are many health conditions that could be improved with cleaner air. I think the savings in health-care costs and less pollution would make it worth it.

### 作答

In my opinion, there's no need for free public transportation, since it doesn't cost too much nowadays after all. For example, a high school student who takes the subway to go to school will only spend 4 yuan on public transportation, which is the same value as a bottle of water. Instead, adding one more tax may cause unfairness, due to the fact that people who don't need public transportation will pay an extra amount of money. For instance, teachers who live in school and don't need transportation still need to pay an extra amount of fee. In conclusion, though having free access to public transportation seems to be ideal, it's unnecessary in fact and unfair to some people.

>**Professor** Next week, we'll be discussing the role of museums in society, and we'll explore the various contexts, social and otherwise, in which museums operate. Today, I'd like you to think about the benefits of museums. **For a city and its residents, what do you think is the most significant advantage of having a museum located in that city? Explain why you think so.**
>
>**Andrew** Museums can inspire people in many ways. If a city has a museum, people **have access to out-of-the-ordinary experiences.** Whether in a room with sixteenth-century paintings or some moon rocks, being near fascinating objects from the past transports people out of their everyday lives. It can offer them a new perspective or a sense of possibility in their lives.
>
>**Student 2** Andrew makes a good point, but personally, I see greater benefit in the social aspect of museum-going. I think the biggest advantage of having a museum nearby is that people **can come together for events like exhibitions and lectures or to volunteer**. Museums foster a sense of community in a city. They can unite people in a common appreciation of something.

### 作答

I totally agree with Andrew's point about the cultural meaningness of the museum and I would like to add something. As far as I'm concerned, museum are a significant cultural and historical symbol of a city by providing a splendid glimpse of the city. Therefore, not only does it improve the attractiveness of the city, but also it foster the sense of cultural pride for every residents in city. For example, the well-preserved treasures in Luoyang's museums attract global visitors, showcasing the region's rich history. These institutions also play an educational role, providing students with hands-on learning experiences. In conclusion, museum are an important element of a city due to its cultural impact and education meaningness.

>**Professor** This week, we'll be discussing how technological advances are transforming the job market, making some jobs unnecessary. Let's focus on government actions. Suppose the government had to choose between two ways in which to support people whose jobs are no longer needed. The government could either give them enough money to live on until they find new jobs or offer them free job training without giving them money directly. Which of these two solutions do you think is better? Why?
>
>**Andrew** I believe that the government should prioritize providing free job training opportunities. Modern training programs are usually costly, which means that many people will not be able to afford them without the government's funding. By participating in training programs, people will develop new, in-demand skills and become more competitive in the job market.
>
>**Kelly** Although I agree that having access to free training programs sounds promising, I think the government's first step should be to give people enough money to live on until they find new jobs. This money will go directly into people's pockets and allow them to make their own choices concerning their future.

### 作答

Both Andrew and Kelly have made good points, and I believe offering free job training is better, since this method protects the self-esteem of the people. By helping them developing new, in-demand skills, these people will still gain the sense of achievement and confidence from their process of earning the payoff and maintain a proper status in society. In contrast, if they're offered money directly, they will define themselves as a failure in society, losing hope and confidence and only expecting money from government from day to night. In conclusion, while providing money directly is more straight and can solve the problem immediately, offering free job training and teaching them skills are better for their well-being and beneficial for the long term.

>In 1930, a famous economist predicted that at the end of the twentieth century, an average worker would work only 15 hours a week, thanks to advances in technology. This did not happen, as we all know. Nonetheless, the balance between work time and free time remains an interesting question. So, let me ask you today: Twenty years in the future, will people have more leisure time (free time) and less work than they have today? Why, or why not?
>
>**Claire** I think it is likely that people will work shorter hours in twenty years than they do today. Our societies are becoming wealthier all the time. It does not seem necessary for people to continue working as hard as they do today. At some point, having more free time should be more important than creating more wealth.
>
>**Paul** I am not sure people will work less in the future. As Doctor Achebe wrote, a shortening of the workweek was predicted before. There are many factors that determine how long people work. Our economic system is very competitive. Workers are pushed to work longer and longer hours so that companies have a competitive advantage.

### 作答

In my opinion, people will spending less time working and gaining more leisure time in the future. With the development of technology, different hard works are becoming automated, thus requiring less time for people to finish. For instance, with the rapid development of AI technology, people spend less time processing data in their work, dramatically improving work efficiency and saving a huge amount of time. Still, a voice arises that our competitive economic system will force workers to be more diligent regardless of the time. Ironically, from the whole perspective, the working time is saved in total and the coompetitiveness will be represented in other aspects, such as the quality and the ability to solve the emergencies.

    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "saving a huge amount of time" 有些重复，因为 "dramatically improving work efficiency" 已经暗示了时间的节省。
    - **Suggestion:** "with the rapid development of AI technology, people spend less time processing data in their work, dramatically improving work efficiency."
- **Error 5:** "Still, a voice arises that our competitive economic system will force workers to be more diligent regardless of the time."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "a voice arises" 不是一个很正式的表达，且 "regardless of the time" 在这里略显模糊。

## Exercise TPO 35 4/5

> [!EXAMPLE] TPO 35
> Write a post responding to the professor’s question.
> In your response, you should:
> - express and support your opinion.
> - make a contribution to the discussion in your own words.
>An effective response will contain at least 100 words.
>
>**Professor** Over the next few weeks, we're going to talk about recent trends in education. Specifically, we'll discuss how many universities have started letting students take classes from home instead of taking them in person on campus. I want to know what you think about this issue, so here's a quick question for the discussion board: "What do you think is the most significant impact of online classes? Why do you think it has this impact?"
>
>**Jack** The main thing is that online classes make education more accessible. For one, they help reduce commuting time and costs and give students more flexibility in their schedules. Plus, online learning can be more accessible for students who have disabilities or live far away from campus. Traditionally, high costs have prevented many people from pursuing an education, but thanks to online classes cost is less of a problem.
>
>**Emily** I think that online classes cause people to learn less than before. There's something to be said for the energy and engagement that comes from being in the same physical space as your classmates and instructor. Moreover, when we take classes in person it is easier to build relationships and collaborate. We learn just as much from personal connections as we do from our actual lectures and textbooks.

### 作答

In my opinion , online classes make it more personalized for people to get new knowledge. Not only can students can take online classes anytime and anywhere flexibly, but also they can take in the knowledge in a proper speed customized for them by palsing or listening to the same part over and over again. Moreover, with the rapid development of AI technology, some online platforms can offer personalized learning experiences that adapt to each student's strengths and weaknesses, which is difficult to achieve in a traditional classroom setting. In conclusion, online classes offer a more personalized approach to acquiring new knowledge through their flexibility, self-paced learning opportunities, and the increasing integration of AI-powered personalized learning experiences.

## TPO 74 - Public Transportation

**你的回答：**

In my opinion, there's no need for free public transportation, since it doesn't cost too much nowadays after all. For example, a high school student who takes the subway to go to school will only spend 4 yuan on public transportation, which is the same value as a bottle of water. Instead, adding one more tax may cause unfairness, due to the fact that people who don't need public transportation will pay an extra amount of money. For instance, teachers who live in school and don't need transportation still need to pay an extra amount of fee. In conclusion, though having free access to public transportation seems to be ideal, it's unnecessary in fact and unfair to some people.

**1. 打分：**

- **内容 (Content): 3/5** - 你的观点明确，并且提供了一个基于价格的理由和另一个基于公平性的理由。然而，你的论证比较简单，缺乏更深入的解释和细节支撑。例如，你声称公共交通花费不多，但没有提供更广泛的数据或考虑不同城市和收入水平的情况。关于公平性的论点也比较直接，可以进一步探讨不同社会群体对公共交通的需求和税收的受益情况。
- **表达 (Language): 3/5** - 你的语言基本清晰易懂，能够表达你的观点。但存在一些小的语法和词汇问题，且句式结构相对简单，缺乏多样性。

**2. 语言错误 (Language Errors):**

- **Error 1:** "there's no need for free public transportation, since it doesn't cost too much nowadays after all."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "after all" 在这里显得有些突兀，语气不够正式，并且并没有提供额外的信息来支持“花费不多”的观点。
    - **Suggestion:** 可以删除 "after all" 或者用更正式的短语来连接你的观点，例如 "because the current cost is relatively low."
- **Error 2:** "For example, a high school student who takes the subway to go to school will only spend 4 yuan on public transportation, which is the same value as a bottle of water."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 使用具体的货币单位 "yuan" 对于一个国际性的讨论来说可能不够通用，并且用一瓶水的价值来衡量交通费用显得过于简化，没有考虑到长期累积的费用和不同地区的物价水平。
    - **Suggestion:** 可以使用更通用的表达，例如 "For example, the cost for a high school student to commute to school by subway might be comparable to the price of a common everyday item." 或者避免使用具体的货币单位。
- **Error 3:** "due to the fact that people who don't need public transportation will pay an extra amount of money."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "due to the fact that" 过于冗余，可以用更简洁的表达。
    - **Suggestion:** 可以改为 "because people who do not use public transportation would have to pay extra."
- **Error 4:** "For instance, teachers who live in school and don't need transportation still need to pay an extra amount of fee."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "need to pay an extra amount of fee" 中的 "amount of fee" 有些重复，可以用更简洁的表达。
    - **Suggestion:** 可以改为 "For instance, teachers who live on campus and do not require transportation would still have to pay this additional tax."
- **Error 5:** "though having free access to public transportation seems to be ideal, it's unnecessary in fact and unfair to some people."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "in fact" 在这里显得有些生硬，并且句子结构可以更流畅。
    - **Suggestion:** 可以改为 "While free public transportation might seem ideal, it is, in my opinion, unnecessary and potentially unfair to certain groups."

**3. 语法结构 (Syntactic Structures and Grammatical Structures):**

- **Error 1:** 句子结构过于简单，多为简单句，缺乏句式变化，例如 "In my opinion, there's no need for free public transportation..." 和 "Instead, adding one more tax may cause unfairness..."
    - **Why it's an error:** 缺乏复杂的句式结构会使文章显得单调，影响表达的流畅性和准确性。
    - **Correct Expression:** 可以尝试使用从句、短语等来构建更复杂的句子，例如 "I believe that free public transportation is unnecessary because the current cost is relatively low..." 和 "Furthermore, the implementation of an additional tax to fund free public transportation could be considered unfair..."
- **Error 2:** "people who don't need public transportation will pay an extra amount of money." - 动词时态一致性，如果讨论的是未来可能发生的情况，可以使用 "would pay"。
    - **Why it's an error:** 时态不一致会造成理解上的困惑。
    - **Correct Expression:** "people who do not need public transportation would pay an extra amount of money."
- **Error 3:** "museum are a significant cultural and historical symbol" (在第二篇作文中出现，但这里一并指出) - 主谓不一致。
    - **Why it's an error:** 名词 "museum" 是单数，动词 "are" 是复数。
    - **Correct Expression:** "museum is a significant cultural and historical symbol."

**4. 文章结构 (Clarity and Understandability for Unfamiliar Readers):**

- **Evaluation:** 对于不熟悉讨论背景的读者来说，你的文章结构基本清晰，你首先提出了你的观点，然后提供了两个理由来支持你的观点，最后进行了总结。
- **Suggestion:**
    - 可以在开头更明确地回应教授的问题，例如 "In response to the professor's question about whether public transportation should be free to all, I believe it should not be."
    - 在每个理由段落的开头使用更清晰的主题句，概括该段落要讨论的重点。
    - 在提供例子之后，可以稍微展开解释一下这个例子如何支持你的观点，避免例子显得孤立。

**最终得分：内容 3/5，表达 3/5。综合得分：3 分。**

## TPO 71 - Museums in a City

**你的回答：**

I totally agree with Andrew's point about the cultural meaningness of the museum and I would like to add something. As far as I'm concerned, museum are a significant cultural and historical symbol of a city by providing a splendid glimpse of the city. Therefore, not only does it improve the attractiveness of the city, but also it foster the sense of cultural pride for every residents in city. For example, the well-preserved treasures in Luoyang's museums attract global visitors, showcasing the region's rich history.1 These institutions also play an educational role, providing students with hands-on learning experiences.2 In conclusion, museum are an important element of a city due to its cultural impact and education meaningness.

**1. 打分：**

- **表达 (Language): 3/5** - 你的语言基本流畅，能够表达你的观点，但也存在一些语法和词汇上的小错误，以及不够正式的表达。

**2. 语言错误 (Language Errors):**

- **Error 1:** "cultural meaningness"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "meaningness" 不是一个常用的词汇，表达“意义”可以使用 "significance" 或 "importance"。
    - **Suggestion:** "cultural significance" 或 "cultural importance".
- **Error 2:** "museum are a significant cultural and historical symbol"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 主语 "museum" 是单数，动词 "are" 是复数，导致主谓不一致。
    - **Suggestion:** "museum is a significant cultural and historical symbol".
- **Error 3:** "by providing a splendid glimpse of the city"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 表达略显不自然，可以使用更简洁的表达。
    - **Suggestion:** "by offering a splendid glimpse into the city's past."
- **Error 4:** "it foster the sense of cultural pride for every residents in city"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 主语 "it" 是单数，动词 "foster" 应该使用第三人称单数形式 "fosters"。 "every residents" 应该是 "every resident" 或者 "all residents"。 "in city" 应该是 "in the city"。
    - **Suggestion:** "it fosters a sense of cultural pride among all residents in the city."
- **Error 5:** "museum are an important element of a city due to its cultural impact and education meaningness."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 主语 "museum" 是单数，动词 "are" 是复数。 "its" 指代单数名词 "museum"，所以 "education meaningness" 应该改为 "educational significance" 或 "educational importance"。

## TPO 67 - Government Support for Unemployed People

**你的回答：**

Both Andrew and Kelly have made good points, and I believe offering free job training is better, since this method protects the self-esteem of the people. By helping them developing new, in-demand skills, these people will still gain the sense of achievement and confidence from their process of earning the payoff and maintain a proper status in society. In contrast, if they're offered money directly, they will define themselves as a failure in society, losing hope and confidence and only expecting money from government from day to night. In conclusion, while providing money directly is more straight and can solve the problem immediately, offering free job training and teaching them skills are better for their well-being and beneficial for the long term.

**1. 打分：**

- **内容 (Content): 4/5** - 你清晰地表达了你的观点，支持提供免费职业培训，并给出了明确的理由，即这种方式有助于保护失业人员的自尊心和自信心，并着眼于长期的福祉。你对比了直接提供资金的不足之处，论证较为充分。
- **表达 (Language): 3.5/5** - 你的语言表达基本清晰，能够有效地传达你的观点。语法和词汇方面有一些小错误，但整体而言表达比较流畅。

**2. 语言错误 (Language Errors):**

- **Error 1:** "By helping them developing new, in-demand skills"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** 在介词 "by" 之后，动词应该使用动名词形式。
    - **Suggestion:** "By helping them develop new, in-demand skills" 或 "By helping them in developing new, in-demand skills."
- **Error 2:** "these people will still gain the sense of achievement and confidence from their process of earning the payoff"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "earning the payoff" 在这里略显口语化，且表达可能不够准确。职业培训本身不直接带来经济上的 "payoff"，而是提升就业能力。
    - **Suggestion:** "these people will still gain a sense of achievement and confidence through the process of acquiring new skills and improving their employability."
- **Error 3:** "maintain a proper status in society"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "proper status" 略显模糊，可以使用更具体的表达。
    - **Suggestion:** "maintain their social standing" 或 "maintain their dignity and social integration."
- **Error 4:** "if they're offered money directly, they will define themselves as a failure in society"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "they're" 是 "they are" 的缩写，在正式学术语境中应尽量避免使用缩写。
    - **Suggestion:** "if they are offered money directly, they may perceive themselves as failures in society."
- **Error 5:** "losing hope and confidence and only expecting money from government from day to night"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "from day to night" 略显口语化，且表达可能有些夸张。
    - **Suggestion:** "potentially leading to a loss of hope and confidence, and fostering dependency on government support."
- **Error 6:** "while providing money directly is more straight and can solve the problem immediately"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "straight" 在这里不是一个合适的词语来形容提供资金的方式，可以使用 "direct" 或 "immediate"。
    - **Suggestion:** "while providing direct financial assistance may offer an immediate solution."

**3. 语法结构 (Syntactic Structures and Grammatical Structures):**

- **Error 1:** 句子结构可以更加精炼和正式。例如，第二句 "By helping them developing new, in-demand skills, these people will still gain the sense of achievement and confidence from their process of earning the payoff and maintain a proper status in society." 可以尝试拆分成更清晰的句子。
    - **Why it's an error:** 句子较长，信息量大，略显冗余。
    - **Correct Expression:** "Providing free job training can help these individuals develop new, in-demand skills. This process can foster a sense of achievement and confidence, enabling them to maintain their social standing."
- **Error 2:** 注意连词的使用，例如 "since" 和 "in contrast" 连接的句子在逻辑上是否足够清晰。

**4. 文章结构 (Clarity and Understandability for Unfamiliar Readers):**

- **Evaluation:** 结构清晰，你首先表达了你的观点，然后阐述了支持你观点的理由，并对比了另一种方案的不足，最后进行了总结。
- **Suggestion:**
    - 可以在开头更明确地回应教授的问题，例如 "Regarding the government's role in supporting people whose jobs are no longer needed, I believe that offering free job training is a more effective approach than providing direct financial assistance."
    - 在对比两种方案的段落中，可以更清晰地使用对比性的连接词，例如 "On the other hand," 或 "Conversely,"。

**最终得分：内容 4/5，表达 3.5/5。综合得分：4 分。**

## TPO 55 - Future of Work and Leisure Time

**你的回答：**

In my opinion, people will spending less time working and gaining more leisure time in the future. With the development of technology, different hard works are becoming automated, thus requiring less time for people to finish.3 For instance, with the rapid development of AI technology, people spend less time processing data in their work, dramatically improving work efficiency and saving a huge amount of time. Still, a voice arises that our competitive economic system will force workers to be more diligent regardless of the time. Ironically, from the whole perspective, the working time is saved in total and the coompetitiveness will be represented in other aspects, such as the quality and the ability to solve the emergencies.

**1. 打分：**

- **内容 (Content): 3.5/5** - 你表达了你的观点，认为未来人们将拥有更多休闲时间，并给出了技术进步导致工作自动化的理由。你用人工智能的例子进行了说明，并且考虑到了竞争性经济体系可能带来的反驳意见，并尝试进行了回应。

    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "will" 后面应该跟动词原形。
    - **Suggestion:** "people will spend less time

- **Error 2:** "different hard works are becoming automated"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "hard works" 不是一个常见的表达，可以更具体或使用更合适的词语。
    - **Suggestion:** "various demanding tasks are becoming automated" 或 "many labor-intensive jobs are being automated".
- **Error 3:** "thus requiring less time for people to finish"
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "thus" 引导的句子结构可以更流畅。
    - **Suggestion:** "thus requiring less time for people to complete them" 或 "leading to a reduction in the time people need to spend on work."
- **Error 4:** "with the rapid development of AI technology, people spend less time processing data in their work, dramatically improving work efficiency and saving a huge amount of time."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "saving a huge amount of time" 有些重复，因为 "dramatically improving work efficiency" 已经暗示了时间的节省。
    - **Suggestion:** "with the rapid development of AI technology, people spend less time processing data in their work, dramatically improving work efficiency."
- **Error 5:** "Still, a voice arises that our competitive economic system will force workers to be more diligent regardless of the time."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "a voice arises" 不是一个很正式的表达，且 "regardless of the time" 在这里略显模糊。
    - **Suggestion:** "However, some argue that our competitive economic system will still pressure workers to be more diligent, regardless of potential time savings from technology."
- **Error 6:** "Ironically, from the whole perspective, the working time is saved in total and the coompetitiveness will be represented in other aspects, such as the quality and the ability to solve the emergencies."
    - **Why it's inaccurate/imprecise:** "from the whole perspective" 可以更简洁地表达为 "overall" 或 "from a broader perspective"。 "coompetitiveness" 是一个拼写错误，应为 "competitiveness"。 "will be represented in other aspects" 可以更直接地表达。 "the emergencies" 应该是 "emergencies"。
    - **Suggestion:** "Ironically, overall, while the total working hours may decrease, competitiveness will likely manifest in other areas, such as the quality of work and the ability to handle urgent situations."

**3. 语法结构 (Syntactic Structures and Grammatical Structures):**

- **Error 1:** 时态使用不一致，例如开头使用 "will spending"，后面使用 "spend"。
    - **Why it's an error:** 时态不一致会造成理解上的混乱。

## Exercise 13

The university has a funding allocation and needs to determine whether to prioritize the construction of a university library or the support of students’ sports activities. Andrew presents an argument in favor of promoting students’ sports activities ,which can promote students’ physical health. However, I am inclined to prioritize the construction of a new library. In my view, a new library can enhance teaching and scholarly communication **by providing a central hub for intellectual exchange and collaboration**. A well-equipped library not only provides access to printed books but also offers high-speed Internet connectivity. For example, both faculty and students in our Architecture Department requires establishing a new library that enhances networks cross departments, **which**  . Therefore, I believe that constructing a new library will improve scholarly communication and our research capabilities, **laying a solid foundation.**

## Exercise 14

In my opinion, universities are **decisive** in expanding one’s knowledge.
**Explanation:** (但是不是很detail)
There is no denying that one could gain knowledge from both the textbooks and teachers, which will inevitably lead to his/her personal accomplishment.

Take Isaac Newton for an example, **who is widely accepted as one of the most influential physicists and mathematicians worldwide**. (**介绍**) Through his tertiary education in Physics at Cambridge, Newton read a large number of **books** written by famous scientists, including Copernicus and Galileo, and frequently conversed with his **teacher, Barrow**, for a more comprehensive understanding of classical mechanics. As a result, he succeeded in formulating the law of gravitation that has dominated the physics world for centuries.（personal accomplishment）

具象的，最好有细节（Detail）

并列的例子：
有逻辑的：progress - sacrifice

## Exercise 15

 I think every progress has its cost as there is no free lunch in the world. **For instance**, a student’s progress on mathematics is probably gained by paying less attention to other subjects, and a career-oriented young man could have sacrificed most of his leisure time or even health to compete for promotion and pay rise. For some countries or regions, they might have long been using their fresh air and clean water to exchange for a speedy economic development. In this case, the long lasting pollution and its chain harm to both nature and society have become the expensive and detrimental costs tightly associated with the economic progress that has been achieved.

## Exercise 16

I think participating in community activities is a practical and effective approach for teenagers to enhance their social skills. For instance, participance in volunteering work can not only provide them with chances to interact with diverse groups of people, but also . Additionally, joining in clean-up activities in community will rich their experience in cooperating with others. These experiences help  teenagers to shape their characteristics and responsibililty as.

如果事情是较为笼漉的，那么最好是具体的人：a friend of mine
如果人是笼统的 - teenager, 那么事情最好是具体的：host an English conversation group

## Exercise 17

In my opinion, the intensifying pressure to compete among children to go to a better school increases juvenile delinquency. In such a fiercely competitive society, children are under enormous pressure from many aspects, among which the competition for better schools is one of the most intense. Children who fail in the entrance examination are deprived of the opportunities to receive a better and higher education. Accordingly, without an impressive educational background, it is difficult for them to find a proper job. As a result, they become full of resentment at a society, doing harm to strangers and disrupting social order, both of which vitally increase juvenile delinquency

## Exercise 18

Teenagers tend to overuse their cell phones, which creates many problems. There're so many information and resources of mixed quality on the Internet, some of which will lead to addiction for teenagers today.

## Exercise 19


 Comparison and Contrast

I agree that the Internet has brought great convenience for individuals to get access to large amounts of information. It becomes extremely convenient for travelers, for example, to search information about local cuisine by logging on the Internet when they first visit a city. Local residents can also be greatly benefited from the Internet by knowing the closest community center and hospitals. **By contrast**, all the convenience were impossible before the Internet first came into our daily life. Travelers had to carry with them a load of travel information and local residents had to ask other people for the information. Without the Internet, it will be much troublesome for people to obtain the information they need.

## Exercise 21

Argumentation

数字式、引用式、具体的事情/事物式的

In my opinion cities include a vast number of academic and cultural facilities. A child who visits such places on a regular basis will undoubtedly become very interested in some of them. In addition, they will be able to make well-informed decisions about their future. My own experience is a compelling example of this. When I was young I lived in a major urban area, so my parents could easily take me to a cultural event almost every weekend. We attended book readings at the local library, art openings at many of the galleries throughout the city, and literary festivals during the summer. As a result of attending these outings I developed a strong interest in artistic expression, and decided to major in music at university. Now I enjoy a successful career as a recording artist. For this reason, I strongly believe that it is worthwhile to grow up in a large city.

## Exercise 22

1. 阐述背景
2. 先阐述自己的观点，用例证法
3. 提到同学的观点，赞成/反对

例如：
The topic of globalization has generated much discussion in recent years. My personal belief is that when nations interact together it leads to less suffering. For example, people who suffer from natural catastrophes can import goods and services to help mitigate (reduce/alleviate) their losses and recover quickly. Citizens of nations who may be going through war or famine can flee to neighbouring countries for shelter. I understand Alex’s concern over cultural homogenization, but I believe she misses another critical point. Much of the food found in grocery stores around the world is imported. Our very diet is due to the international trade partnerships and alliances forged over the last half of the 20th century. International trade and travel are not possible in a world without globalization, which is why I believe it is crucial to maintain our current global policies for a safer world with a higher standard of living.
