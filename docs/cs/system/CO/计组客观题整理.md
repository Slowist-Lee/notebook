7.  A program originally takes 10 seconds to run. We manage to parallelize 80% of our code to be 10 times faster, at the cost of 1.2 seconds of overhead. How many times faster is our new code? (2021-2022 P94, P102)
    A. 2.5
    B. 5
    C. 10
    D. None of the above

8.  A given application written runs 15 seconds on a desktop processor. A new compiler is released that requires only 0.6 as many instructions as the old compiler. Unfortunately, it increases the CPI by 1.1. How fast can we expect the application to run using this new compiler? (2010-2011 P111)
    A. 8.2sec

### **I/O、中断与其他 (I/O, Interrupts & Others)**

1.  The wrong statement/s regarding interrupts and subroutines among the following is/are `_____`. (i) The subroutine and interrupts have a return statement (ii) Both of them alter the content of the PC (iii) Both are software oriented (iv) Both can be initiated by the user (2020-2021 P2)
    A. i, ii, and iv
    B. ii and iii
    C. iv
    D. iii and iv

2.  Unlike processor benchmarks, I/O benchmarks concentrate on throughput rather than latency. (T/F) (2013-2014 P12)

3.  The communication between central system and the outside environment is done by `_____`. (2014-2015 P29)
    A: Input-output subsystem
    B: Control system
    C: Memory system
    D: Logic system

4.  Which of the following statements about flash memory is wrong? (2014-2015 P29)
    A: The information can be either read or written, and the read speed is the same as write speed.
    B: The storage unit is consist of MOSFET, so it is a semiconductor storage.
    C: Information will not lose after power down.
    D: It can be a replacement for the external memory.

5.  The method of synchronising the processor with the I/O device in which the device sends a signal when it is ready is`______`. (2014-2015 P29)
    A: Exceptions
    B: Signal handling
    C: Interrupts
    D: DMA

6.  What is the average time to read or write a 512-byte sector for a typical disk rotating at 10,000 RPM? The advertised average seek time is 6 ms, the transfer rate is 50 MB/sec, and the controller overhead is 0.2 ms. Assume that the disk is idle so that there is no waiting time. (2014-2015 P30)
    A: 6.0ms
    B: 9.0ms
    C: 9.01ms
    D: 9.21ms

7.  Which of the following I/O mechanisms requires the least hardware support? (2016-2017 P47, P53)
    A. Polling
    B. Interrupt
    C. DMA
    D. None of the above

8.  When the process is returned after an interrupt service (______) should be loaded again. i) Register contents ii) Condition codes iii) Stack contents iv) Return addresses (2017-2018 P61)
    A. i, iv
    B. ii, iii and iv
    C. ii
    D. i, ii

9.  The direct memory access (DMA) is worse for large transfers than interrupts due to the overhead of setting up the transfer. (T/F) (2017-2018 P64)

10. Interrupts can be generated in response to `_____`. (2019-2020 P86)
    A. detected program errors such as arithmetic overflow or division by zero
    B. detected hardware faults
    C. input/output activities
    D. All of the above.

    A. Compiler
    B. Assembler
    C. Linker
    D. Loader

12. The DRAMs are basically used as ______. (2023-2024 P120)
    A. register
    B. cache
    C. main memory
    D. disk
